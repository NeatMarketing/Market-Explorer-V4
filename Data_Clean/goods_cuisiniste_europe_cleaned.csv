È specializzato nella produzione e nella commercializzazione di manufatti in legno e altri materiali destinati alla fabbricazione e all’assemblaggio di mobili. Vanta una lunghissima esperienza nel settore delle cucine componibili che risale al 1960, quando l’imprenditore Giuseppe Arangiaro dette inizio a un’avventura di grande successo. In breve tempo, Cubo Design ha conquistato il mercato italiano riuscendo a imporsi da protagonista anche in quello internazionale. Fanno parte del gruppo, guidato dal CEO Antonio Arangiaro, Miton Cucine e Binova. Il primo brand propone collezioni “democratiche” pensate per dare a tutti la possibilità di fruire di prodotti di elevatissima qualità a prezzi concorrenziali. Binova, invece, è un’azienda che dal 1958 rappresenta un punto di riferimento nel comparto delle cucine di alta gamma.  Punto di forza del gruppo è il concetto di Made…inside, ossia il passaggio dalle isole, situate in località diverse, a un metodo produttivo concentrato esclusivamente nello stabilimento aziendale. La sede di Cubo Design è Factory-One, un polo avveniristico di 25.000 mq che è stato fra i primi del settore Legno-Arredo a essere progettato secondo il concetto di Impresa 4.0. Macchinari tecnologici avanzati e intercomunicanti, sottoposti al continuo controllo di manodopera specializzata, consentono di accogliere le richieste dei clienti garantendo altissimi standard qualitativi. Grandissima l’attenzione alle tematiche della sostenibilità ambientale non solo grazie all’impegno del gruppo di realizzare prodotti a km 0 riducendo del 25% gli spostamenti logistici, ma anche tramite l’acquisizione di specifiche certificazioni (come la FSC che assicura che il legno usato nelle collezioni Cubo Design provenga da una gestione responsabile delle foreste) e l’uso di vernici all’acqua, indicate per ambienti domestici e lavorativi salubri.  .",Italy,40.90671,,,

It began as a love story. Sometimes winning the lottery leads to more than just temporary excitement. When Vipp founder Holger Nielsen won a car on his ticket to the local soccer stadium in 1932 it was the beginning of Vipp. He just did not know it. He sold the car, bought a metal press and few years later, when his wife Marie needed a bin for her hairdressing salon, he went to his one-man workshop and crafted what today is known as the Vipp pedal bin.  Holger could not have imagined that the pedal-controlled bin he designed in 1939 would eventually sow the seed for a full-blown design universe of accessories, furniture and kitchens. Nor that his bin would be a catalyst for a design hotel concept.

Nata nel 1949, Gio’Style è leader in Italia nei contenitori in plastica per la conservazione degli alimenti, nei frigo portatili e nelle borse termiche: grazie ai suoi prodotti i consumatori possano gustarsi il piacere e la gioia del buon cibo, sia in casa che fuori casa. Gio’Style crede in un mondo dove non esistono più gli sprechi alimentari: questi hanno un nefasto impatto sulla biodiversità e sul clima, senza considerare il fatto che ogni anno in tutto il mondo viene buttata una quantità di cibo pari a 4 volte quella che servirebbe a sfamare le quasi 800 milioni di persone che sono denutrite. Ridurre lo spreco alimentare non significa quindi solo prendere coscienza dello sperpero economico ma implica una consapevolezza più forte legata al nostro futuro e alla tutela del nostro pianeta.  La nostra missione è conservare cibi e bevande preservandone al meglio le caratteristiche organolettiche: il cibo è l’elemento attraverso cui passa la convivialità, attraverso cui si scandiscono le giornate, l’elemento che unisce le persone e le famiglie e conservarlo è il valore tangibile più prezioso dei nostri tempi.

Πέραν όμως των προκλήσεων αυτών, τα καρκινογόνα υλικά που χρησιμοποιούνταν τότε κατά κόρων για την κατασκευή των επίπλων κουζίνας, του δημιούργησαν ένα σοβαρό αναπνευστικό πρόβλημα που τον σταμάτησε προσωρινά... Το γεγονός αυτό αποτέλεσε για τον ίδιο ένα κίνητρο, καθώς τότε ήταν που άρχισε να αναζητά εργοστάσια τα οποία να χρησιμοποιούν μόνο οικολογικά και φιλικά προς τον άνθρωπο υλικά. Το αποτέλεσμα; Οι πρώτες του συνεργασίες με επώνυμα Ιταλικά εργοστάσια που διασφάλιζαν όχι μόνο τα επιθυμητά αισθητικά αποτελέσματα αλλά κυρίως τη χρήση υλικών χωρίς κινδύνους για την ανθρώπινη υγεία. Μαζί συστρατεύτηκε άμεσα ολόκληρη η οικογένειά του με τα παιδιά, Άρη, Γιώργο και Σοφία να ξεκινούν ένα δύσκολο ταξίδι ως «Ομάδα» εξού και το όνομα: Gruppo Cucine. Η αρχή δεν έγινε από κάποιο γραφείο ή κατάστημα, αλλά από το παιδικό τους δωμάτιο έχοντας ως πυξίδα έναν απλό ηλεκτρονικό υπολογιστή, ένα δανεικό πρόγραμμα σχεδιασμού κουζίνας και μια βαλίτσα από δείγματα. Οι «εναλλακτικές λύσεις» έπαψαν να υπάρχουν ως ενδεχόμενο, ενώ η αποτυχία δεν υπήρχε ούτε ως ιδέα, ούτε ως λέξη. Χωρίς κεφάλαιο, χωρίς δάνεια ή κρατική βοήθεια, με μόνη κινητήρια δύναμη το ένστικτο, το πάθος και το όραμά τους να αλλάξουν το Status quo στον χώρο των επίπλων κουζίνας, ξεκίνησαν αυτό το όμορφο αλλά δύσκολο και απαιτητικό ταξίδι. Το ταξίδι αυτό κρατά για την «ομάδα», που πλέον αριθμεί πάνω από 100 μέλη, 21 δημιουργικά χρόνια!",Greece,29.181163,,,

Der deutsche Hauptsitz liegt heute in Korschenbroich. Quooker ist ein Familienbetrieb, der sich auf Begeisterungsfähigkeit und Unternehmergeist gründet. In den 1970er Jahren hatte Quooker-Erfinder Henri Peteri die geniale Eingebung, einen revolutionären Wasserhahn zu erfinden - und zwar einen, der die damals neumoderne Instantsuppe wirklich instant machen würde. Die Idee des Kochend-Wasserhahns war geboren und heute ist er der neue Standard der hochwertigen Küche. Der Nutzen geht weit über die Instantsuppe hinaus. Der Quooker ist das meistgenutzte Küchengerät, da er zum Kochen, Blanchieren, Reinigen u.v.m. verwendet wird. Durch die Einführung des CUBEs im Jahr 2018 wurde der Kochend-Wasserhahn zum Wasserhahn, der alles kann. Denn nun ist es möglich, neben dem warmen, kalten und 100°C kochenden Wasser, auch gekühltes sprudelndes und stilles Wasser aus nur einem Hahn zu zapfen. Bei Quooker arbeiten wir mit großer Leidenschaft an unserer gemeinsamen Vision: Wir wollen so viele Küchen wie möglich auf eine clevere, energiesparende und sichere Weise mit kochendem Wasser versorgen.

Aangezien 5 jaar na het ontstaan van Weber Meubelen de ruimte in het centrum te klein werd hebben wij besloten uit te breiden. In 1991 werd er een magazijn gebouwd met showroom op het industrieterrein Kruismaten, dit als aanvulling op de bestaande winkel in het centrum. In 1996 hebben wij nog een “lowbudget” winkel geopend op het industrieterrein Kruismaten aan de haven. Aangezien het niet eenvoudig was om 3 verschillende winkels te exploiteren binnen 1 plaats en omdat er een nieuw industriegebied werd ontwikkeld op een prachtige locatie in Elburg, hebben wij besloten hier een prachtig pand op te bouwen en ons te concentreren op 1 locatie. Dit is het huidige pand van Weber Woonwereld, met diverse woonwinkels onder 1 dak kunt u hier slagen voor de totale inrichting van uw woning.

Back then we manufactured simple pieces of metal, but we soon expanded our range with new products and mechanical technology. Over the following years, the development of the company was accompanied by the industrial revolution of the area. Towns such as Eibar and Mondragón stood out nationally and we constantly incorporated increasingly advanced and complex technology in our products. Later in the 20th century the creative and competitive capabilities of our engineers continued to grow. We had to supply a market that was increasingly challenging and international. We needed to meet all the needs in the kitchen and, as a solution to these demands, BOJ GLOBAL emerged. Thus, the catalogue of products gradually expanded over the years. In addition to the manufacture of implements related to wine and kitchenware, we added small appliances and, a little later, a wide range of domestic appliances. In short, we provide a global service. This diversification in products has been accompanied by a diversification in markets. In what is a big step in our development, we have entered markets such as China, the Middle East, Egypt, Iran, the USA and all of Europe, including the Baltic countries. All of this growth is the result of the work and effort of our great team of people. These professionals, with more than 20 years of experience both nationally and internationally, are the reason why BOJ GLOBAL is a consolidated and recognised brand across half of the world.

Nevertheless, stylists and designers in the furnishing and clothing sectors were able to quickly reach success.

With the market focused on high end consumers, Tisettanta, always protecting its “Made in Italy” tradition, set its sights on an accessible version of design without giving up excellence. Every great story starts with a change. Taking action boldly and adopting new strategies is the company’s distinctive characteristic. In the 1970s, they expanded their production plant to make high quality furniture lines created by prestigious designers. Everyone should be surrounded with beauty. Tisettanta knows this, and offers you the chance to enjoy a special modern atmosphere. In 1999, a company specialised in kitchen design called Elam entered the Tisettanta group. A series of important steps marked the company’s growth, bringing it to an interesting level of market share and placing it at the top of its range in revenue. Now, as in the past, Tisettanta can thank the passion of the Pedrazzani family for its range of original, essential furnishings and innovative, versatile solutions.

A well-designed interior breathes an atmosphere that expresses your values, views and life philosophy. We don’t make kitchens. That wouldn’t be a challenge. No fun. No improvement. But. What we do consider a challenge – and what we always find fantastic fun – is making room for people. Preferably for you – and for all the things you find important in life. Every project we undertake is just as unique as you are, and is always an interpretation of your personality and character. We have a taste for the timeless – both in design as in material choice – and like to construct things so that they’ll outlast a lifetime. We are always in search for the right balance between sustainability and aesthetics, which fortunately prove to go hand in hand. What we also find important is that we do all of this in an intelligent way. We source sustainable materials only and minimize our waste in every step of the process. Sustainability We’ll never use any toxic or chemical components in our kitchens. We only use sustainably sourced natural materials. This is why we’re convinced steel enthusiasts. Steel is beautiful, light, incredibly durable and endlessly recyclable. The wood we use comes from a sustainably managed forest and is processed by a family-owned factory in Finland. The workshop There are few things you can imagine that can’t be built in the workshop. Yet we encourage you to try. There’s virtually no limit to the constructional puzzles our passionate people can piece together. Our team of experienced craftsmen are the finest within their fields of expertise. Whether it’s marble carving, woodworking or stone cutting – they know the drill. If you’ve got the space, we’ve got the time.

Door het succes van de keukenformule besloot Hummel ook sanitair en tegels aan het assortiment toe te voegen. Daarmee groeiden we uit tot de Keuken- en Badkamerspecialist van Noord-Nederland.

Ons concept: de basis leggen voor onze eigen granietfabriek in Thüringen (grootste in Duitsland) om vervolgens vanuit onze eigen showrooms in Duitsland (32 winkels) en Nederland keukens met graniet aan te bieden. Daar worden onze keukens verkocht tegen fabrieksprijzen. Dat is het voordeel van onze eigen fabriek. Marquardt Küchen is het enige keukenmerk in Duitsland met een eigen granietfabriek; de grootste granietfabriek van Duitsland. Dankzij dit concept en onze 25 jaar garantie op graniet is Marquardt Küchen in Duitsland inmiddels uitgegroeid tot marktleider op het gebied van keukens met graniet. Om dit unieke concept verder uit te rollen zijn er ook 3 winkels gestart in Nederland, namelijk Utrecht, Breda en Rotterdam. Bij Marquardt heeft u de grootste keuze uit natuur- en kwartssteen en we maken alles voor u op maat op basis van uw wensen.

To begin with, the company was operated as a side-line enterprise, but grew steadily. One could say that the turning point in the operation was when Tengi began importing Mora bathroom and kitchen mixers in 1985. We are 100% behind the goods that we sell and the service aspect is a key issue. We have had excellent collaboration with designers, architects, plumbers and other professionals in the construction industry. We strive to follow all the latest trends in the sector as regards new products, and constantly seek to be the leader in the introduction of innovations; of looking at the environment in its present and future states. We regard Tengi as a professional company collaborating with professionals. We try to present our goods in a professional manner through e.g. presentations and exhibitions where representatives from the manufacturers are present. It is clear that professional interest into developments in the plumbing industry has increased considerably over the years and that plumbing issues have also become somewhat of a hobby. A company is only as good as the people who work in it. Tengi has been extremely lucky in having many exceptional employees. Many of our employees have been with Tengi for many years and have extensive experience and knowledge of bathroom/kitchen fittings and plumbing materials. A united team is a fantastic advantage for any company and that is something that we certainly have.  Tengi will continue to seek to be a leading company and build up the operation in the same manner as hitherto; those who know us know the quality of the services that we provide. We are very grateful for the many customers and suppliers who have built a long-term relationship with us based on reliability, trust and tailored services.",Iceland,4.916152,,,

In the six years since, over a million people have come around to the XOUXOU way of life — staying constantly connected, forever hands-free. XOUXOU was born in 2016. It was the product of a personal need — the annoyance that comes from being dependent on your devices: constantly attached to a phone figuratively, but not physically. Dropped, forgotten, cracked, completely misplaced — we know you know what we’re talking about. It all started with a strap that transformed a phone case into a Phone Necklace — and provided the simple, effective and now essential answer to staying connected, hassle- and hands-free. At XOUXOU, we believe good design is self-explanatory. That’s why all our products are made with your needs in mind. No frills, no fuss; just forthright, functional, high quality design that doesn’t break the bank. From the curvature of our Phone Cases down to the clasp closure of a carabiner, every aspect of a XOUXOU product is built to serve a purpose — and look good doing it.

Die Anwendung tradierter Handwerkstechniken ist der Dreh- und Angelpunkt unserer Tätigkeit. Daraus resultiert ein optisches Gesamtbild mit Ecken und Kanten, das sich von industriellen Standards abhebt. Bauphysikalisch erfüllen wir die Anforderungen der DIN 105 hinsichtlich Frostbeständigkeit und Druckfestigkeit. Traditionelles, intarsiertes Feinsteinzeug ist, neben dem Porzellan, das widerstandsfähigste keramische Material. Die farbigen Feinsteinzeug-Tone werden von Hand in eine Form gefüllt und als ca. 3 mm dicke Intarsienschicht mit dem Trägergranulat verpresst. Nach ca. 70 Stunden im Brennofen, können unser Feinsteinzeug-Fliesen ohne weitere Oberflächenbehandlung verlegt werden. Unsere historischen Bodenfliesen sind qualitativ sehr hochwertig. Die Dicke der Ornamentschicht und die Härte des Materials garantieren die Haltbarkeit über Generationen. Sie eignen sich aufgrund Ihrer hervorragenden Materialeigenschaften für für stark beanspruchte Bereiche für Hotel- und Gastronomiebetriebe, wie den Hausflur, oder auch im frostgefährdeten Außenbereich für Terrassen und Balkone.  Unsere Jugendstilfliesen produzieren wir genau so anspruchsvoll, wie sie um 1900 in den europäischen Fliesenmanufakturen hergestellt wurden. Bei der Modellherstellung und Glasurentwicklung achten wir auf ein authentisches Erscheinungsbild. Nur am einheitlichen Format und dem Logo auf der Rückseite kann man unsere Fliesen von den Originalen unterscheiden. Mit einem Malhörnchen füllen Malerinnen die Flächen mit farbigen Glasuren. Das aufgeprägte Stegrelief fungiert dabei als Barriere zwischen den verschiedenfarbigen Glasuren und verhindert deren Ineinanderlaufen. Die so entstehenden Repliken von Jugendstil- und Art-Déco-Fliesen werden durch ein umfangreiches Sortiment an Bordüren und schönen Uni-Fliesen ergänzt und sind für die Neugestaltung von Küchen, Fluren und Bädern bestens geeignet.",Germany,3.958605,,,

In questi trent'anni di attività, l'azienda ha acquisito una straordinaria esperienza nei settori del legno e degli articoli per il fai da te, e tale bagaglio di competenze è oggi a disposizione di quanti devono arredare, rivestire e rifinire ambienti ad uso abitativo o lavorativo. Riguardo al settore taglio e lavorazione legno, è dal 1992 che le macchine sono controllate da computer. Presenza allora singolare in un centro fai da te, è rimasta il fiore all'occhiello del reparto. Vista la ricca esposizione, Hobby & Legno è a tutti gli effetti un punto vendita della grande distribuzione, dove è possibile trovare semilavorati e prodotti finiti in legno di diverso tipo e dimensione, oltre che elettroutensili, attrezzi, collanti, vernici, ecc. Da qualche anno è inoltre centro design, con cucine, divani e altri arredi, anche per ufficio, che si rivolgono a chi è in cerca dell'alta qualità e dello stile ricercato. Grazie a Hobby & Legno, è finalmente possibile acquistare questi mobili senza rinunciare alla convenienza che solo un centro bricolage può offrire. Il punto vendita si distingue anche per la gamma di servizi altamente professionali associati alla vendita, ovvero la progettazione, la consulenza sull'uso dei prodotti, il taglio di pannelli, il sezionamento e la lavorazione del materiale, la consegna e la messa in opera. Non a caso Hobby & Legno annovera fra i clienti, in aggiunta alle famiglie e agli enti pubblici e privati, i professionisti del settore arredamento e gli artigiani, che qui trovano un partner affidabile, in grado di offrire assistenza, qualità e convenienza.",Italy,3.78973,,,

Siamo i primi a farlo, in Italia, seguendo tutte le fasi del processo: andiamo a casa del cliente, prendiamo le misure, lavoriamo il cemento in azienda e poi ritorniamo per l’installazione. Realizziamo i nostri prodotti con la tecnica Gfrc (cemento e fibra di vetro). In questo modo otteniamo un prodotto personalizzabile, artigianale e leggero. PRODOTTI IN CEMENTO SU MISURA Sono il cuore della nostra attività. Realizziamo manufatti in cemento da quattro generazioni. Di questo materiale conosciamo tutte le caratteristiche, la sua resistenza e la sua duttilità. È da questa tradizione che abbiamo deciso di fondare Cemento Line: la potenza del cemento non può essere confinata alla produzione di serie. Ognuno di noi è unico e ognuno di noi merita un progetto su misura, un po’ come una seconda pelle.  PIANI CUCINA IN CEMENTO GFRC  Crediamo nel futuro e nella versatilità: in sintesi le caratteristiche del materiale che produciamo. Quindi, non ci siamo mai fermati, e ora lavoriamo il cemento Gfrc. Ci siamo formati dal più importante maestro europeo di cemento decorativo: Mr. Huub Waterreus. Ed oggi eccoci qui, a proporre il metodo Cemento Line. COSTRUTTORI DI SOGNI Il cemento ci dona una grande opportunità: quella di costruire i nostri sogni. Non è solo questione di oggetti o di prodotti, ma di vita e relazioni. I sogni si costruiscono nella quotidianità e la quotidianità comincia a casa, in cucina. Ma le relazioni sono anche quelle che nascono sul luogo di lavoro: crediamo molto nella sinergia con architetti, progettisti e interior design.

In early 2016, Kine Ask Stenersen and Kristoffer Eng embarked on a transformative journey by founding Ask og Eng studio. Their story began with a simple desire to create sustainable solutions, starting with building their first kitchen in their apartment. Drawn to the beauty of bamboo—a material discovered by Kristoffer during an architectural project—Kine’s background in environmental sustainability combined seamlessly with her love for interior design. With no prior experience in construction, they embraced the challenge of making their own kitchen in bamboo and quickly fell in love with crafting beautiful pieces for their home. This initial venture blossomed into more than just kitchens; as they awaited the arrival of their first child, they built another stunning bamboo kitchen, and the brand was formed! Starting with a workshop in the garage, which soon expanded to take over their entire home. Fast forward ten years, and Ask og Eng has evolved significantly from those early days. Today, they offer not only bespoke kitchens but also bathrooms, storage solutions, and handcrafted furniture & have several immersive showspaces throughout Europe, and a thriving workshop in Norway. While also undertaking many bespoke interior architecture projects around the globe, which have been featured in design books and magazines.

Schnell hat sich das Team einen guten Namen gemacht: Erstklassige Markenküchen jeder Preisklasse vom Fachmann ausgemessen und eingebaut. Wobei der Service nach dem Einbau freilich nicht aufhört.  Schon im Dezember 1992 folgte der Umzug in die Landsberger Straße. Hier standen auf zwei Etagen und 400 Quadratmetern über 15 Küchen zur Ansicht bereit. Gleichzeitig wechselte das Unternehmen auch seinen Namen in „Küche und Plan Wieser“.  „Ehrlichkeit dem Kunden gegenüber gehört zu unserer Firmenphilosophie“, betont Maria Wieser. Das bedeutet, dass der Kunde rundum beraten und ihm keine unnötige Ausstattung verkauft wird. Die ideale Küche darf kein Fremdkörper im Haus oder der Wohnung sein, sondern muss zum Charakter des Besitzers passen und auf seine Bedürfnisse abgestimmt sein. Das Wichtigste ist für den Küchenkauf ist daher die Information. Am Computer entstehen verschiedene Perspektiven der künftigen Küche. Dabei nimmt das Team von Wieser auf die Kundenwünsche Rücksicht. Das genaue Ausmessen der Örtlichkeiten gehört zum selbstverständlichen Service. Auch in den Abendstunden kümmert man sich um seine Kunden und nimmt sich die Zeit für ein Beratungsgespräch. Heute ist wieserKüchen Arbeitgeber für zwölf Mitarbeiter und arbeitet mit einer Reihe von Unternehmen, die z.B. für einen fachgerechten Aufbau sorgen, eng zusammen.

Fan & Fun Shop is not like any other shops that offers products related to popular and world-known franchises because the concept was invented by people who are passionate about the same type of merchandise. Basically, Fan & Fun Shop was created by fans for fans, and that is why every single product on the website was carefully picked, not only to attract a large range of potential buyers, but also because we as founders want to have all of them on our shelves as well. Whether you are a huge fan of Harry Potter, or you are into cosplay and want to dress up as a Star Wars charachter; if you collect different figures from LOTR, or you just love to drink coffee from unique and cool mugs, this is definitely the place to find all of the above. If you are not a fan, don't give up on us just yet. Fan & Fun Shop is also a gift shop. The point is that everyone can find something either for themselves or their friends and family, and be sure that your gift will be the most awesome ever! Our goal is to provide you as our customers with the best of the best. In other words, we will try hard to always have something new, cool, and special to offer. Most importantly, we will make sure that each product has its purpose, either being a collectable, useful in the kitchen or bathroom, or just something that will be fun to have in your home. Ultimately, we want to make everyone happy. The idea behind the web shop is not only to sell fun stuff but also to build a community where everyone can express themselves freely. Judging is just not in our style. If you prefer Hufflepuff, or you have a crush on Legolas, if your favorite hero is Flash; don't be ashamed of who you are and what you like. Be proud to be a fan, geek, or a nerd. This world desperately needs more people who are „different“ and out of the ordinary. Raising awareness about this kind of culture is a very important part of our mission.",Croatia,2.842346,,,

They are also experts in listening and understanding in order to help you make the decisions that are best for you in the long term.",Belgium,2.80772,,,

Something new is created and delicious creations grow like germs from an old onion to the heights of the kitchen sky.

No frills. But large, uncovered, crispy fried pieces of meat that lie on the plate like thick pillows. Inside, the rooms are bathed in twilight. A man is just venting his tension at the cloakroom. In the night cat gray of the side booth, a couple kisses their lips bloody and believes in love. Insiders mingle with outsiders, creative types with people in business uniforms, trend darlings with Felix Krull oddballs.

Selskabet blev stiftet i 1953, og siden starten har god kvalitet, høj faglighed og innovation været omdrejningspunktet for virksomhedens aktiviteter. Bl.a. derfor har PFP igennem mange år været kendt som ""Den danske bordpladespecialist"". Det er et renommé vi er stolte af, og en ”titel” vi dagligt forsøger at gøres os fortjent til. PFP står for Post Forming Production – en teknik udviklet i virksomheden, hvor man bukker laminat over en afrundet kant af spånplade. Laminatproduktion var således virksomhedens udgangspunkt, og PFP er fortsat en af Europa´s førende og mest alsidige producenter af specialløsninger i laminat. I dag er PFP A/S specialiseret i at producere og sælge skræddersyede bordplader i laminat, massivtræ, Dupont™ Corian®, kompaktlaminat, granit, kompositsten, Ceramic, FormaCor, glas og stål. Langt de fleste bordpladeløsninger leveres idag med monterede vaske. Også her var PFP den første til at introducerer dette i laminat, og blandt de første og mest innovative på flere af virksomhedens andre produktkategorier. Hos PFP har vi stor fokus på detaljen i håndværket. Uanset hvilket materiale vi arbejder med, stræber vi altid efter at levere kundetilpassede bordplader på højeste kvalitets niveau. Vi går ikke på kompromis. Køkkenet er det rum i hjemmet hvor vi tilbringer de fleste vågne timer. Bordpladen er det der giver køkkenet eller spisebordet sin identitet, og samtidig er det den overflade hvor der arbejdes og slides mest i huset. Derfor er bordpladen en af de vigtigste elementer i et hjemmet, og således også en af de vigtigste og sværeste beslutninger for boligindretningen. Derfor sætter vi en ære i at gøre beslutningen lidt lettere, løsningen lidt anderledes og bordpladen meget bedre for vores kunder og deres kunder.",Denmark,2.636799,,,

A uno form kitchen is your guarantee of the finest joinery created by passionate craftsmen of long-standing tradition. uno form was originally developed by the ingenious visionary Arne Munch, who in 1968 designed the very first uno form kitchen. The kitchen offered a radical alternative to the inflexible, heavily crafted kitchens of the time, which allowed neither freedom nor originality in terms of kitchen layout. From the basement of his home in Lyngby, Arne Munch created an entirely new kitchen concept, whose simple ingenious design revolutionised kitchens. Arne Munch was inspired by the attractive and original cabinet furniture of the time and insisted on incorporating this same elegance and high quality into his kitchen design. With this in mind, he created the uno form kitchen with its characteristic slotted fronts, which have made uno form a genuine Danish design classic and one which has retained its originality for 45 years. With the refined slotted design, Arne Munch also introduced the handle-free kitchen, a revolution that highlighted both functionality and aesthetics.",Denmark,2.619584,,,

Blueside è tutto questo: musica sotto forma di oggetti, di opere che puoi toccare e utilizzare, emozione a portata di mano… L’utilizzo del vetro come materia prima di base, ma anche l’apertura a materiali diversi come ceramica,legno,metallo,plastica, tessuti e l’interpretazione del progetto da parte di designers giovani e più affermati, fanno di Blueside un progetto innovativo e sorprendente, capace di contaminarsi e mantenere allo stesso tempo una connotazione originale…tutto questo è design emozionale.",Italy,2.551055,,,

Midarte Arredamenti,2086124.0,"Italy, Lombardy, Lissone, 25 Via Francesco Baracca, 20851",https://www.linkedin.com/company/midarte,www.midarte.com,"Midarte nasce a Lissone con l’intenzione di unire la progettazione personalizzata e la produzione di arredamenti di alto livello, forte di una lunga esperienza di ebanisteria. Quattro generazioni nel mondo del mobile hanno unito l’esperienza creativa di Gianni Arosio con l’evoluzione delle tendenze dell’arredamento e l’utilizzo delle più moderne tecnologie, fino a fondere il tutto nella realtà unica ed esclusiva di Midarte. Midarte unisce il design, la praticità e l’unicità in un felice connubio, il tutto grazie ad un processo unico che va dal progetto fino alla produzione finita dei tuoi mobili. A Midarte progettiamo, realizziamo e vendiamo direttamente al pubblico; siamo convinti che il cliente si debba sempre rivolgere direttamente al produttore per avere il miglior prodotto, creato per lui e senza intermediari. I nostri mobili sono unici, originali, funzionali e mantengono la loro bellezza e solidità nel tempo. Negli anni abbiamo creato uno stile architettonico inedito, espressamente ispirato alle linee curve e sinuose, mantenendo il legno, materia prima nobile, come protagonista. Lo stile Midarte è così diventato un simbolo dell’arredamento curvo. Arte, design, esclusività, arredamenti personalizzati. Da questi principi va formandosi lo spirito di Midarte, la nostra piccola grande realtà aziendale, che ha deciso di selezionare ed utilizzare i migliori legni provenienti da ogni parte del mondo. Ogni passaggio viene seguito con meticolosità e attenzione sino alla realizzazione finale di ogni pezzo, sempre unico, sempre diverso. Dalla curvatura all’essicazione naturale del legno fino alla lucidatura, utilizzando tecniche artigianali di un tempo. Quello che Midarte vuole realizzare, in ogni progetto, è un prodotto unico ma riconoscibile, esclusivo e fatto su misura per te. Midarte è riuscire ogni volta ad esprimere nuovi concetti, energia, creatività. Arredamenti curvi, certo, ma anche qualcosa in più: coinvolgimento, talento, poesia, colore, emozioni e amore per i dettagli. Midarte è l’unione tra la lavorazione artigianale e le tecnologie più innovative per creare arredi personalizzabili dall’effetto seducente e magnetico. Il nostro showroom, nel cuore del polo del mobile in Brianza, è il segno tangibile di un lungo percorso d’artista, quello di Gianni Arosio, scultore, designer e fondatore di Midarte, appassionato lavoratore del legno. Qui puoi riscoprire, in un dedalo di cucine, soggiorni, camere da letto, bagni e mobili curvi e curvati, angoli d’arredo che esplorano il modo di guardare al design della famiglia Arosio, tra passato e futuro, elegante e funzionale. Ogni angolo della tua casa può diventare prezioso, ritroviamo i tuoi spazi di vita e ne creiamo di nuovi, rendendo la tua casa un ambiente accogliente e ricco di fascino.

Inspiration från proffsen gör det inte bara roligare att laga mat, det leder även till val som har en positiv påverkan långt utanför det egna köket: När vi är fler som kan mer så kan vi ställa krav på bättre råvaror och på bättre djurhushållning. Vi blir fler som satsar på kvalitet och på att tillvarata jordens resurser – med mindre svinn som följd. Vi kommer att visa lite större respekt för planeten för varje måltid vi lagar.

Forte di una storia trentennale e di una filiera produttiva d’avanguardia, Oikos propone nuovo modo di produrre arredi, dove le componenti costruiscono un telaio-matrice adattabile allo spazio, al budget e alle esigenze del cliente. Una rivoluzione chiamata Cucina Zero, per esprimere l’azzeramento dei processi canonici e favorire una cooperazione inedita tra l’azienda ed il suo pubblico, co-autori di inedite composizioni. La cucina come massima espressione della quotidianità individuale, alter ego di chi la utilizza, protesi delle sue azioni, emblema del suo gusto estetico.",Italy,1.555835,,,

This innovation led to an entire collection of high-quality cooking tools. Today Steak Champ is an innovative line of grilling and kitchen tools made from sustainable materials. Our goal is to help consumers prepare, cook, and serve steak to achieve restaurant quality results. Endorsed by some of the world’s leading steakhouse chefs, we believe that we have a responsibility to develop consumer products that are made from the highest quality materials that do not harm the environment. For our knife handles, we have chosen to replace virgin plastic with Ocean Bound Plastic. Currently, there is over 5 trillion macro and micro tons of plastic in our oceans. It is also our responsibility to reduce and over time eliminate this problem. We’re excited to do our part, product by product, to make a better and tastier world. We are based in Bavaria Germany (yes, we do own and wear Lederhosen, but not really all the time) and maintain a distinguished network of renowned barbecue experts, consummate foodies and steakhouse chefs that challenge our ideas and stand proudly behind our products.

CLEANCOOK owns tooling for manufacturing and product patents. Production is outsourced to a partner company in South Africa. So far, 55.000 cleancook stoves have been provided, which correspond to 15 million accident-free user-days, mainly in Africa. The CLEANCOOK stove technology is based on a pressureless canister concept which has been used in Europe and the USA by the canister supplier, Dometic Group, for more than 30 years. More than 3 billion people worldwide use solid biomass for their cooking, such as charcoal and firewood. However, cooking on solid biomass not only dirties kitchens with soot, it also kills. WHO reports that 4 million people die prematurely from illnesses related to air pollution caused by emissions from inefficient stoves and solid biomass-based cooking. The CLEANCOOK concept leads to cleaner ambient air in cities, courtyards, and homes, eliminating smoke and improving health. Deforestation and emissions from inefficient fuel combustion, such as soot and greenhouse gases, also have major negative impacts on the environment. Calculations show that up to 20% of global climate change can be attributed to cooking and heating with solid biomass and kerosene in the developing world. Collecting firewood and lighting up charcoal and wood stoves are time-consuming tasks. Additionally, women and young girls collect firewood frequently risk molestation and sexual assault. Cooking with alcohol fuels is fast, safe, easy, and affordable and eliminates the need for collection of firewood. By using clean fuels such as ethanol and methanol, families, and especially women, have more time for schooling, working/entrepreneurial activities, and other household tasks.",Sweden,1.319535,,,

Wildkamp was founded in 1972 by Jan de Wilde, a born entrepreneur, who made sure the company grew exponentially right from the start. The company continued to grow with Gert-Jan de Wilde at the helm, who like his father continued to introduce new products time and time again. Fast-forward to 2017 and Wildkamp has become a major technical wholesaler and retailer with 46 branches and 300 employees. Let us take you back to the year 1995. Gert-Jan is on a mission to find construction toys for his two young sons. “I wanted to give them something with symmetry, that you can add to on all sides. Try as I might, I could not find what I was looking for. So I decided to design it myself.” Gert-Jan sits down at his kitchen table and starts designing the toys that have now become Twickto. He officially records his designs with a civil-law notary and later applies for a patent. His ideas are then put in a safe, where they remain for twenty years. But Gert-Jan never forgot about them.  2015 comes around. The idea gets a second life thanks to Gert-Jan’s son Robin de Wilde. “My father took me to the Spielwarenmesse international toy fair in Germany several times. We kept coming to the same conclusion: there is nothing even remotely similar out there. So I said: let’s turn it into something big. That’s my ambition now.”",Netherlands,1.292,,,

XERA By Arex,1043062.0,"Italy, Treviso, Mareno Di Piave, 1 Via Galileo Galilei, 31010",https://www.linkedin.com/company/xera-by-arex,www.xeraonline.com,"AN UNCONVENTIONAL KITCHEN. NO, WE DO NOT WANT TO BE UNIQUE. BUT SPEAKING OF A XERA KITCHEN YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SPEAK IN THE PLURAL. EVEN IF THE WORD IS SINGULAR. Within a Xera kitchen there are many worlds. There are many environments and ways of thinking. There is the kitchen of the great chefs, with its sophisticated appliances and the ample working island, but everything fits discreetly in the existing living space, so as to become a veritable furnishing system. There is the minimalist design of an industrial kitchen in steel, the “Km Zero” steel of Xera and its working, as well as the warmth of the wood and of the treated stone. This is why the Xera kitchen is unconventional because there’s nothing else like it. Think as you like, the kitchens. All these feelings can be realised and live indoors, outdoors, and be thought Taylor Made. STEEL, A LANDSCAPE OF DESIGNS. OUR RAW MATERIAL. There are no projects without steel. The story of man, and the desire for progress, the use of a formula that is able to translate any sign of innovation. Xera is a company specialised in the working of steel, from its experience a product line is born which highlights structural quality. Every door is an architectural project; every structural detail is a piece of engineering. For us the aesthetics of a product is the consequence of a technical characteristic. The design is an interpretation. ERGONOMICS AND STRUCTURAL QUALITY. STEEL IS OUR SKIN. Our product culture is born from a solid structural soul. An exclusive premise for construction entirely in steel makes our kitchens unique. Steel is our skin, a noble material, unalterably hygienic. We have inherited the product culture of top professional restaurants, and we believe in hidden qualities. As with the best raw materials, all the true quality and original flavour hides within an ingredient.",Italy,1.043062,,,

Fascinated by the simplicity of ingredients — mesmerised by the multitude of fragrant hops — he went deep into the rabbit hole, making the science his own. When given the opportunity to be put “at the end of a broomstick” at local microbrewery Young Henrys, the dream was born. Go big! Drawing experience from many past lives, our brewer now has only one mission — make great beer… and drink it too.  Pieter Langendijk “The Connector” After twenty-odd years as an entrepreneur in hospitality, he sought a new challenge. Collaborate with like-minded , engage in a Creative Process, produce a Tangible Product. The puzzle pieces dropped into place when the idea was proposed to start brewing beer. An extension to his past, this venture would hold the potential to cover all three goals profoundly.

Sleepy Bottle,1043062.0,"Slovenia, Ljubljana, Ljubljana, 1000",https://www.linkedin.com/company/innovat-pro-d-o-o,,"The design story The inspiration for Sleepy Bottle came after a sleepless vacation with my friends and their 3 months old son. During night time feeds the whole house was woken up, not by the sounds of crying hungry baby, but by the dad rumbling around in the kitchen boiling water, cleaning bottle and generally fiddling his way through the steps for preparing of many bottles that week. After a sleep deprived “vacation” I decided there had to be a “better way”. Two years later I designed a first prototype which dramatically simplified night time baby feeding by warming the water to 37°C while you sleep. Also, Sleepy Bottle offers a closeable design that allows baby formula to be kept dry and seperate from the water until it is time to feed your baby. This means baby formula is fresh, always on the right temperature, and always ready when the baby needs it. Sleep well Moms and Dads <3",Slovenia,1.043062,,,

The scientific answer to the perfect pizza in the home oven!  Everyone loves pizza, just like from their favourite Italian restaurant. But unfortunately it never turns out so perfectly at home in the kitchen. Many think this is primarily due to the dough. The secret of the original Italian pizza, however, is quite different.  The professional pizza stone oven works at approx. 400°C and is made of fireclay bricks. This stores the heat particularly well, but also releases it slowly. Not everyone has a professional pizza stone oven at home and therefore prepares their pizza in a conventional oven. Many amateur chefs also use pizza stones, as these are also used in professional pizza ovens.  The sobering result: the pizza is not crispy, but chewy. The pizza stone transfers the heat to the dough too slowly. From a scientific point of view, this is also plausible. The conventional oven manages a maximum of 300°C and not the desired 400°C. The contact temperature, which is decisive for the baking result, is therefore too low. However, this can be changed by changing the material pairing. Instead of the pizza stone, a material with a higher thermal conductivity is needed.  Together with our scientific experts, we have selected the ideal steel, examined it and optimised all parameters. The polished surface additionally increases the heat transfer. Thus, with the Steelizioso oven steel, the same baking result as in the professional pizza stone oven can be achieved, thermodynamically proven: The pizza becomes soft and open-pored on the inside and beautifully crispy on the outside.  Delizioso! And that became Steelizioso!",Germany,1.034586,,,

Bronson Outdoor,1034586.0,"Germany, Berlin, Berlin, 12 Bouchéstraße, 12435",https://www.linkedin.com/company/bronson-outdoor,bronson-outdoor.com,"Martin Thacker, a Canadian expat, founder and CEO of Bronson, established the company in 2010 not long after he arrived in Berlin, Germany. At that time he was working as an artist and photographer with his North American 110-Volt photo equipment, which needed to be converted for the standard European electric system that operates at a 230-Volt grid. To his frustration, he found very limited options, the few solutions available being either unhandy or very expensive, finally deciding to develop his own simple, reliable and affordable solution for this problem. It quickly became clear that there was a larger user group with similar needs as travelers and other expats, trying to use electrical equipment overseas, from musical up to kitchen appliances. Since then, the business has continued to grow and extend its diverse range of power solutions, focusing on creating intelligent and well-designed products, it now serves markets beyond the household expat market including high tech companies and institutions that need to operate specialty equipment with specific power needs. In 2018 the company launched the Bronson Outdoor project, embarking on a journey to develop products for the rapidly growing e-mobility market. Taking from our experience in power conversion technology and applying this to the marine and outdoor market, where there are very limited and often unaffordable solutions to help people transition from fuel-burning power to clean energy. Through lean product development and a highly efficient supply chain, we are now bringing to the market safe, reliable, and long-lasting power solution products developed at the highest quality while maintaining affordable prices.",Germany,1.034586,,,

Entweder waren sie beschichtet, rosteten, versprachen “schnelleres Backen” oder sonstige Geschichten. Cynthia und Esmé wollten einfach gute Backformen.    So fingen sie an sich die perfekten Backformen auszumalen. Rostfrei sollten sie sein, eine gute Hitzeverteilung haben und unbeschichtet sollten sie auch sein. Zudem legten sie einen großen Wert darauf, wie und wo sie hergestellt werden.    In England fanden sie einen Hersteller, der ihre Vision umsetzen konnte. Ein Familienbetrieb, der in zweiter Generation Backformen aus anodisiertem Aluminium herstellt. Ein Besuch vor Ort in der Manufaktur und sie waren überzeugt: hier sollten die Cynthia Barcomi Kitchenware Backformen produziert werden.

I paralumi, i lampadari da tavolo, da soffitto o da parete, diventano dei veri e propri complementi d’arredo. Costruire un paralume a mano è una forma d’arte. La passione, la cura dei dettagli e la qualità dei tessuti, delle stoffe e dei materiali utilizzati, hanno permesso alla Bottega Artigiana Paralumi di diventare uno dei simboli della creatività bresciana. Nel 2007 la Bottega Artigiana Paralumi si trasferisce nell’attuale sede di via M. Cesaresco, alle porte del centro storico, in un locale completamente ristrutturato che accoglie una vasta esposizione di lampadari e paralumi. La Bottega Artigiana Paralumi realizza ogni genere di paralume completamente a mano conferendo quindi un altissimo livello di personalizzazione e un’assoluta esclusività in ogni singolo articolo.

Nel 2019 abbiamo aperto il nostro primo punto fisico nel centro storico di Civitavecchia, la nostra città natale, Cosamimettooggi lab: una boutique con angolo caffè. È un concept store di nicchia dove si possono acquistare abiti da donna, accessori, scarpe, borse e articoli per la casa accuratamente selezionati.  Il nostro caffè-boutique nasce dall’idea di Elisa, proprietaria, moglie mamma e appassionata di moda, settore nel quale lavora in qualità di personal shopper dal 2012. Grazie ad uno spiccato senso estetico, Elisa ha saputo creare un piccolo locale in cui è piacevole trascorrere del tempo.... magari seduti all’aperto a degustare un ottimo cocktail e del finger food, oppure in camerino a scegliere il giusto abito per un party, una cena di gala o semplicemente per ballare a piedi nudi nella cucina della propria casa. Il nostro motto è “vivi a colori”, più che un motto è uno stile di vita: vuol dire scegliere la gonna di tulle invece che il tubino nero, vuol dire cambiare strada, cambiare idea, cercare sempre la bellezza, anche quando non c’è.  Abbiamo scelto marchi che producono in Europa (specialmente in Italia) con designer d’avanguardia e materiali di ottimo pregio, dalla seta al cotone passando per il lino e il ramiè: Tela, Semicouture, Des Petits Hauts, Madame Shou Shou, Phisique du Role, Frnch, Suncoo Paris, King Louie, Kashura, Miss L Fire, The Jackson, Bonne Maison. Accanto a questi marchi siamo alla continua ricerca di accessori artigianali e divertenti,  perché quando aprirete il vostro guardaroba e guarderete i nostri capi e accessori dovrete morire dalla voglia di indossarli.  Ci troviamo a due passi dal mare e dal porto di Civitavecchia, la nostra location è situata all’interno di un’isola pedonale nella quale potrete fuggire i ritmi stressanti della routine e concedervi un pò di relax, ascoltando musica jazz e sorseggiando un buon drink.",Italy,0.87969,,,

I dag er det hovedsaligt håndlavet køkkener og større møbler til private kunder, der bliver lavet. Buchhave Møbelmageri har gennem de sidste 20 år specialiseret sig i at designe og udvikle køkkener, badeværelsesmøbler, garderober, indbygningsreoler og andre møbler til familier, der sætter pris på godt gammeldags håndværk. Vores produktion af romantiske små køkkener bygger på gamle håndværkstraditioner. Alt specialfremstilles og håndlaves på vores snedkerværksted i Tvis. Snedkerkøkkenet og Landkøkkenet er nogle af vores specialer, alle køkkener og møbler kan udnyttes optimalt, når køkkenet designes efter mål. Så standardmål er ikke en del af vores verden, idet alle opgaver laves efter de mål og ønsker den enkelte kunde har. Drømmer man virkeligt om et originalt snedker håndlavet køkken eller møbel vil Buchhave Møbelmageri være et godt bud.

Alt dette gør vi i et tæt samarbejde mellem dig, os og vores dygtige snedkerer. Alle for rammer bliver lavet i massivt fyrretræ, korpus bliver lavet i poppelmøbelplader for at stabilisere. Skuffer og bakker er i massivt træ med softclose. Vi har ikke noget der hedder standard mål. Derfor kan vi udnytte rummet helt ud så man ikke ender med at have 20cm til overs. Buchhaves Møbelmageri tager meget gerne en uformel køkken eller møbelsnak for at hjælpe med at få overblik over de umiddelbare muligheder. Vi udarbejder gerne tegninger og tilbud på et løsningsforslag. Videre i processen kommer vi ud og måler op.",Denmark,0.782689,,,

What started as an inconvenience turned into a journey of inspiration and entrepreneurship. Sebastian’s idea for Elcada came from the kitchen in the form of a triple power outlet.

Today we only recycle less than 25% of our waste. The EU target is to recycle 70% of household waste by the year 2030. In the future we will all have to sort glass, metal, paper,plastic, food and residual waste in our household. It will be a requirement from the municipalities. Sorting is associated with the practical challenges in the kitchen and home, and it's going to require solutions that can meet the demands of the individual households. Valbeing is now launching a flexible solution for sorting waste in the home - both large and small. The solution consists of three different subsystems, all under the SORT-IT concept: SORT-IT rack is based on the idea of flexibility. Our goal is that every household should have a system that is tailored to municipal rules, personal needs as well as the decor in the home. The waste sorting system is designed so that it can be adapted to most homes no matter the size of cabinets. The system can be expanded and adapted to match the authorities' requirements andy he size of the bags can be changed according to everyday needs. The system is easy to install and can be set up in many different places. The most common location would be under the sink, but there is also the possibility of installing the solution on a back stairway etc. The solutions allows you to sort both wet and dry waste, and is designed for both plastic and bio-bags.

Jeg har gennem de sidste 30 år produceret glasfiber produkter til kommuner, amter, boligforeninger, institutioner og sygehuse. Først med produkter til auto branchen, renovation og genbrug og senere kom der en stor produktion indenfor glasfiber og bordplader til køkken, bad og laboratorie industrien, herunder blev der produceret helstøbte vaskeborde i kunstmarmor og integrerede køkkenbordplader uden samlinger - den såkaldte Corrilit bordplade. Jeg fokuserer i dag på produktion, udvikling og salg af skræddersyede ""Corrilit"" bordplader og vaske til køkken og bad samt institutioner og laboratorier. Alle produkter sælges direkte både til private og erhverv. Indenfor de sidste år har vi samtidig udviklet skræddersyede komplette vægge med indstøbt isolering og el til bl.a. svømmehaller, idrætscenter, fitness og motion. LiteBau kommer som isolerede beklædningsplader til f.eks. huse. Disse kan anvendes både ude og inde. Vores seneste udvikling er NewLine badsæt med 10 års fugtgaranti. Disse er special fremstillet til Boligforeninger, hvor der kan forekomme udfordringer med fugt.

From day one, we knew we wanted to create the best pouch on the market. We refurbished an old legacy printing house building with over 100 years of history in the city’s station district, planted our flag, turned it into a vibrant kitchen, and didn’t look back. Rather than outsourcing manufacturing, we decided to build a lively workshop in the heart of Luxembourg and create our pouches from scratch. Pouches are arguably the only safe and convenient way to enjoy nicotine and they provide a discrete moment of pleasure and enjoyment like no other method of consumption. Because of this, we had to get it right! OUR SNUS Snus is actually an old nordic product, invented in Sweden in the 18th century. The original Snus was a small tea bag-like sachet filled with grinded tobacco. The pouch was placed between the upper lip and gum and left in place. While tradition is cool, we knew that a 100% tobacco-free version was what people really wanted today. At Snuskitchen we have managed to design and develop a totally tobacco-free option based on plant-based cellulose, natural flavors, and high-quality nicotine.",Luxembourg,0.627341,,,

Un connubio indissolubile, un binomio inscindibile. La storia di questa ridente valle alle spalle della Riviera di Levante, si intreccia ormai da secoli con la rilevante presenza dell’oro grigio. Si, è opportuno definire così questa pietra considerata dai fontanini e non solo, un prezioso patrimonio da conservare e valorizzare, da far conoscere ed apprezzare ovunque. L’ardesia è una pietra semidura, facilmente lavorabile, utilizzabile per la realizzazione di tetti, pavimentazioni, scale, caminetti piani da cucina e da bagno e non solo… come materiale artistico, per il design e oggettistica. Già in epoca preromana viene utilizzata per la copertura dei tetti e a partire dal Rinascimento, l’apogeo della diffusione. Ma tipi di ardesia, ne esistono tanti, la qualità del materiale sta alla base delle estrazioni, delle lavorazioni del commercio. Ardesia Dondero Italia è tutto questo: qualità garantita da cave di proprietà in utilizzo dal 1948 quando nonno Angelo prima e papà Guido insieme a zio Enrico poi, hanno tramandato agli attuali titolari, quella passione sfrenata per la lavorazione dell’ardesia portando avanti una di quelle tradizioni famigliari che ha reso noto e grande un marchio che da sempre garanzia di prodotti esclusivi oggi ottenuti con le migliori tecniche all’avanguardia nel settore, Insomma è giunto il momento di descrivere più nel dettaglio le fasi della lavorazione. La cava? Quanti pensano che sia solo un luogo buio e lugubre ma costoro non hanno mai assaporato lo strano piacere di visitare uno di quei luoghi che racchiude un piacevole mondo vissuto quotidianamente da esperti operai che si occupano della delicata fase dell’estrazione. Comunque è assodato che  la cava, e tesori che nasconde, decide le sorti dell’azienda. Ardesia Dondero Italia vanta di possedere i filoni di comprovata qualità dai quali si estrapoleranno lastre estremamente resistenti e pronte ad affrontare anche le più impervie condizioni atmosferiche in caso, per esempio,  di copertura tetti. Il materiale è dunque vivamente duraturo e garantisce l’ottima riuscita di tutte le produzioni: a dimostrazione di ciò i tutti i nostri stabilimenti sono ricoperti in ardesia a differenza della concorrenza. Il risultato finale si concretizza in laboratorio quando la pietra assume finalmente l’aspetto richiesto per le diverse lavorazioni ed anche qui il lavoro è minuzioso ed attentissimo alla scelta del materiale più idoneo al tipo di utilizzo. Per quanto concerne la consegna e la posa in opera, ADI si avvale di autotrasportatori e artigiani di fiducia che da molti anni collaborano con noi. Carlo e Andrea, titolari dell’azienda, si trovano in località Villa di Cornia. Esperienza, cortesia e qualità dunque ti aspettano per scoprire insieme quello che possiamo e vogliamo definire l’oro grigio",Italy,0.592359,,,

Vi sliber, grunder og lakerer og sørger naturligvis for en grundig rådgivning om valg af farver og materialer, før vi går i gang. Vi udfører alle former for vådlakering også kaldet sprøjtelakering af træ, plast og metal – som fx inventar, døre, møbler, designmøbler, låger, køkkener, motorcykler, autodele samt diverse. Bygningsmaling Indenfor bygningsmaling har vi udført mange forskellige opgavetyper.  Deriblandt industribygninger, flyttelejligheder, parcelhuse, sommerhuse, institutioner, hoteller etc. Vi kan udføre alle typer opgaver vedrørende vedligeholdelse og renovering af den malede overflade.

Every 4-6 months and with the support of the embassy, a new country is exposed to travel and discover the treasures of the world by using their senses of taste, touch, smell and hearing.   The objective of this cultural project is to broaden the horizons of our children; that by discovering and learning about cultural differences, we can enrich the bonds that connect us as human beings. Open-mindedness and respect for others are values that are transmitted through this experience. The space is decorated and adapted to marvel children and stimulate their curiosity, with a reading corner, games and creative area, movement space as well as a fully-equipped kitchen for cooking workshops. In groups, they will learn, share, experience and move to the rhythm of the country that is exposed. A typical visit goes as follows: The children are invited to participate in a presentation by a multi-lingual workshop leader and discover the country through multi-media, images, stories, questions and answers adapted to their age. After, they will participate in a workshop in order to stimulate active learning by doing, dancing, moving, cooking, or whatever else is proposed. The last part of the visit is a self-discovery of the space around them, a treasure box, dressing up, creating a postcard or exchanging with peers. The different workshops concretely enable the children to learn by having fun in a dynamic and prepared multi-lingual environment adapted to their age group.

Ik maak het niet alleen tot op de centimeter passend, maar zorg er ook voor dat het ontwerp helemaal naar je zin is.  Daarbij verschuif ik de bloemen, dieren en planten in het design zodat de afbeelding mooi blijft en kloppend is. Heb je een muur die niet standaard is? Rare hoekjes? Geen probleem.  ✔ Ik denk met je mee ✔ Wanneer je een preview aanvraagt, heb je die binnen twee werkdagen in huis. Als de preview naar je zin is, krijg je een beveiligde betaallink. En dan heb je je behang binnen een week in huis. Voorbeelden van previews zijn op de site te zien.  ✔ Op maat maken is gratis, je betaalt alleen het aantal m2 behang. Ik heb vinyl behang, vliesbehang met matte coating en Ecotex. De laatste twee zijn 100% recyclebaar. Voor vochtige ruimtes en keukens is er Airtex. ✔ Over mij: Ministry of Happy Walls is mijn geesteskindje. Het idee ontstond toen ik zelf op zoek ging naar mooi behang voor mijn huiskamer. En niet kon slagen. De kleur of de ontwerpen waren het net niet. Leveranciers van op maat gemaakt behang waren te prijzig. En ik wilde gewoon iets aan de muur wat niet iedereen had. Dus ontwierp ik mijn eigen behang. En tot mijn blijdschap bleek er behoefte te zijn aan deze service.  Zo is Ministry of Happy Walls gestart. ✔ Mooie, originele ontwerpen gedrukt op topkwaliteit materialen voor een redelijke prijs, dat is het idee.  ✔Benieuwd naar previews? Kijk eens bij `Uitgelicht'.

Jaren geleden was de keuken puur een werkplek waar alleen een zo efficiënt mogelijke indeling telde. In de loop van de tijd is de keuken uitgegroeid tot een belangrijk onderdeel van ons leven. Hier komen mensen samen, hier vinden vaak lange gesprekken plaats en hier eindigen de geweldigste feestjes.  Er wordt gekookt, gelachen, geluisterd en gepraat.  Kortom: het is een plek waar wordt geleefd. En dat betekent dat het dan ook uitermate belangrijk is om voor een harmonieuse omgeving te zorgen.  Wanneer u overweegt een nieuwe keuken aan te schaffen, dan helpen wij u graag om een keuken samen te stellen die aan uw behoeften voldoet.  Groot LCD scherm  Wanneer u indeling van uw keuken wilt gaan plannen, kunnen we door middel van een speciaal computerprogramma, het nieuwe keukenontwerp op een groot LCD scherm tonen.

Althans, voor die toepassing dan! Wij kunnen bijvoorbeeld van een oude tekentafel, een prachtige industriële tafel maken. Kortom, wij maken uit bestaande voorwerpen, onderdelen of materialen, nieuwe meubels. Uniek Omdat de voorwerpen of materialen die we gebruiken nooit gelijk zijn, of oneindig van voorraad, krijgt ieder meubel zijn eigen unieke uitstraling. Daarom hebben wij ook de filosofie dat je bij ons wel een meubel kunt reserveren, maar het kopen gebeurt pas als je jouw eigen unieke meubel hebt gezien én je ook daadwerkelijk besluit dat déze wilt hebben. Mocht je het om welke reden dan ook niet mooi vinden, dan zit je niet aan de koop vast. Je kunt dus zorgeloos een meubel reserveren. Je zit er niet aan vast. Da’s ook best uniek. Circulair Wij maken uitsluitend gebruik van gerecyclede voorwerpen en materialen. Denk hierbij aan gebruiksvoorwerpen die aan het einde van hun functie zijn, bomen die zijn omgezaagd, of hout dat is gewonnen uit een verloren woning. Ook kunnen wij uw eigen materialen recyclen.

If you look at  Massimilano Furniture, you will see: Minimalism and stability fit together perfectly. To combine beauty and practicality is, after all, the great art, indeed the highest claim of the furniture design. At Massimilano you celebrate this demand in perfection. The company has strictly adhered to the minimalistic style: clear lines, black and white as a basic color, stainless steel elements, no frills that distract from the material. The materials used play a special role here, where stainless steel meets ceramics - and that is no longer the old-fashioned material we know from the tables of our grandparents. Ceramics: the proven new discovery Ceramic is robust, scratch and impact resistant, resistant to liquids and not least particularly light. Today, it is used as a building material for façade design, as a kitchen worktop, for bathroom design, as a floor slab and as a wall cladding, and is also becoming increasingly popular in furniture design. One of the largest manufacturers of innovative ceramic tiles is Laminam. The portfolio of Italians is used wherever ceramics are the material of choice: floor design, facade cladding, furniture construction - because of the high robustness and the diverse designs, the application possibilities are virtually infinite.

No transportation, no middlemen, no recalls; we've made it simple to provide you and your family with the best herbs and greens all year long.  Providing both residential and commercial models, Urban Cultivator has also been adapted by many Canadian restaurants, including Four Seasons Vancouver and Fairmont Pacific Rim, and is a favorite of Martha Stewart, who strongly believes that the company provides an “amazing product.” Through hydroponics, our appliances provide customers the freedom of growing fresh, organic produce in the convenience of their own homes, and chefs in their restaurant kitchens.  While convenience plays an enormous factor in the success of Urban Cultivator’s product, the greens that grow from the machines also have a greater nutritional value and richer flavor when compared with mass-produced wholesale varieties. Eliminating the middleman altogether, restaurant owners may save up to 90% of the cost when growing their own greens versus purchasing flats.",Belgium,0.521531,,,

Our team of designers and engineers was commissioned to create a complete set of furnishings made of granite or marble.

VAKMANSCHAP Evert heeft de vakopleiding voor timmerman doorlopen en heeft ontzettend veel ervaring opgedaan in zijn werk als scheepstimmerman.

In zijn vrije tijd vond Evert veel uitdaging in het omtoveren van interieurs naar een nieuwe landelijke sfeer. Het scherpe oog voor details en de lichte hang naar nostalgie hebben al heel wat succesvolle projecten opgeleverd. Zo is ook te zien in hun eigen huis. Zijn vier kinderen zijn er maar wát blij mee! Zij genieten al langer van hun prachtige kinderkamers! Het werken op de kleine jachten leerde Evert het praktische gebruik van de beschikbare ruimte. Want juist daar is het erg belangrijk om de ruimten zo optimaal mogelijk te benutten. Die zo kenmerkende kennis en vakmanschap heeft Evert de afgelopen tien jaar toegespast in vele woningen. Zijn eigen bedrijf Evert Interieurbouw was dan ook de voorloper van Evert bijzondere interieurs.  Of het nu gaat om een keuken, een praktische bergkast in de hal of een complete slaapkamer.

Bei Griebel Office Design finden Sie darum auch hochwertige ergonomische Möbel, wie Stühle und Tische, denn nichts geht über einen gesunden Rücken. Auch das Licht ist mittlerweile viel mehr als nur Beleuchtung. Neben einem schönen Ambiente verhindert das richtige Licht unschöne Nebenwirkungen wie Kopfschmerzen oder Ermüdungserscheinungen bei der Arbeit.  Natürlich sollte auch die Akustik richtig auf Ihre Räumlichkeiten abgestimmt sein, denn auch hier profitieren Sie gesundheitlich längerfristig von einem durchdachten Konzept und steigern damit ebenso Ihre Effizienz. Zu unserer großen Auswahl an Einrichtungsbedarf, zählt wirklich alles was zu Ihrem Arbeitsplatz gehört. Wir beginnen am Eingang und stellen Ihnen alles für Ihren Eingangsbereich zur Verfügung. Zusätzlich verbinden wir die Funktionalität Ihres Büros mit seinem Erscheinungsbild, Stil und Schönheit. Dafür haben wir eine schier endlose Palette an Büromöbeln und Einrichtungsequipment, das vom Unterlagen-Container, über den Chefarzt-Sessel bis zum Bistro-Board für die Küche reicht. Griebel Office Design ist Ihr Partner, und steht Ihnen von Entwurf und Konzeptionierung, über die Lieferung und Montage durch unser erfahrenes Fachpersonal, bis zur langfristigen Betreuung durch unseren Kundendienst zur Verfügung.  Egal was Sie für Pläne haben, schauen Sie sich jetzt auf unserem Onlineauftritt um und nehmen Sie jetzt Kontakt mit uns auf, das Team von Griebel Office Design freut sich auf Sie!",Germany,0.478373,,,

Ulluv received a great reaction upon launch and consistently since and has made life easier for thousands of pregnant women by the provision of pre-packed hospital bags, luggage that has been designed specifically for hospital and hundreds of individual maternity hospital bag contents items.  In the 7 years since Ulluv launched, it moved from that kitchen table to a co-working space in Tralee town centre and is currently in a large commercial unit in Monavalley Industrial Estate in Tralee. As well as our various premises changes, our proposition has broadened beyond the life event of having a baby and into areas such as general hospital admissions, serious illness and we are currently working on a “first period” range, with lots more plans in the pipeline ☺️.  Ulluv’s mission is to offer a variety of solutions to support women across many of the significant events that can happen during their life.
