Our first product is an automated receivables exchange platform where SME invoices are converted into a tradable asset class called Exchange Traded Receivables (ETRs). ETRs are then sold on an open market where a single ETR can be purchased by one or multiple investors using automated trading bots. Most of the ETRs are filled within seconds of being listed. Unlike our competitors, AREX works exclusively with accounting partners to provide accurate financial pictures of both borrowing firms and their debtors, hence creating a more comprehensive firm’s financial picture while minimizing default risks. Due to this, SMEs typically get lower interest rates while investors get predictable returns with extremely attractive risk/return ratio. The key to AREX’s success lies in our commitment to building a long rewarding relationship with our partners and SMEs.

La soluzione integra al suo interno funzioni avanzate di gestione dei crediti commerciali (Credit Management) con la possibilità di smobilizzare direttamente online le proprie fatture (Invoice Trading) fino alla gestione di una serie di azioni rivolte a migliorare i tempi di incasso (Credit Collection). L’utilizzo della piattaforma prevede l’integrazione con lo scadenziario aziendale, che consente di visualizzare lo status dei crediti aziendali con il profilo di rischio basato su classi di rating, una visualizzazione completa dell’aging dei crediti e una valutazione dell’azienda aggiornata attraverso un algoritmo di rating proprietario dinamico. L’azienda può selezionare interi stock di crediti che intende smobilizzare per ottenere liquidità anticipata, che  vengono  valutati dalla  piattaforma e infine supervisionati da una società di rating indipendente. Infine, gli stock vengono collocati da Credit Service presso investitori istituzionali che acquistano i crediti anticipando finanza all’impresa.  L’operazione di smobilizzo si completa online con l’accredito dell’importo in favore dell’azienda, la quale poi rimborserà l'investitore allo scadere del credito ceduto. Alle funzionalità di analisi e smobilizzo MyCreditService unisce anche la gestione di una credit policy definita dall’azienda, grazie alla quale è possibile attivare una serie di azioni di sollecito che supportano l’azienda nel delicato passaggio dell’incasso e della chiusura della partita di credito/debito.",Italy,8.176246,,,

Mensen die minder tevreden waren over hun geldzaken deden dit vaker.  ✅ De maandelijkse mails rond salarisdatum en de extra mails voor mensen in loondienst werden buitengewoon goed geopend met een gemiddelde over 16 mails van 45%. Wij ondersteunen werkgevers met een financieel vitaliteitspakket, preventie en nazorg voor medewerkers met schulden en loonbeslag, een positieve aanpak voor young professionals om ze te helpen met persoonlijke financiën en studieschuld en activatie rondom het nieuwe pensioenakkoord.

What we do:  1) We bring the booming asset class of music rights & song catalogs to retail investors: Global Rockstar provides an investment platform for retail investors to buy and trade shares in music rights with crisis-resistant yields. Retail investors thereby participate in future royalties of all-time hits and songs from up-and-coming & well-established artists. 2) We offer a new artist financing ecosystem via crowd-investing: Artists sell parts of their music royalties to fans & retail investors. The funds collected are used to cover production costs and marketing. This enables artists to fund and build up their careers while creating long-lasting fan engagement. 3) We enable rights owners to list royalties from successful catalog songs as securities: Artists, songwriters, record labels, publishers and catalog owners benefit from new revenue streams without selling their ownership of songs, while accelerating parts of their future revenues.

When I came up with the vision for the project that aims to provide strategic support to African entrepreneurs and fintechs who have made entrepreneurial decisions. I was so excited to implement the project by taking action after after thinking about it for a short period of time. When I made the first Africa Business Tour to Cameroon in 2022, where I met several entrepreneurs in the technology and other sectors, the feedback I received confirmed my vision that there is a need for my experience and network to help African entrepreneurs shine. I took the opportunity to challenge them to raise the level of their business by taking part in international events and competitions, which they did, and for the first time there were many candidates from Cameroon who took part in #Catapult Africa in #Luxembourg in 2022. In 2023 the Catapult Africa winner was Virginie POUNA NGOMI from COVA Cameroon, whom I also encouraged to take part in this event.  I'm very proud of all the African entrepreneurs who struggle every day to get ahead, and I'm also grateful for my contribution to the development of fintech in Africa and worldwide. For me, this project is multi-dimensional : 1) to share my entrepreneurial experience,  2) to motivate and educate african entrepreneurs,  3) to offer investors the opportunity to discover beautiful projects ""Made in Africa"" in Luxembourg and Europe.

Otly!,1174472.0,"Netherlands, North Holland, Amsterdam",https://www.linkedin.com/company/otly-,www.otly.net,"Otly! is `the’ new way parents can manage, track and control the allowance of their children while teaching them about money, banking and finance. Teaching children how to use and manage money responsibly is the best way to educate them and prepare them for a safe financial future. The app is FREE and will remain free. So, download the app and start the financial education of your children today. In an increasingly cashless society, our kids are left behind when it comes to money, banking and financial education. With Otly, you can set up automatic allowance. Every week (or month), allowance gets added to the account of your children automatically so they can divide it between their saving goals. And because your children are still learning, you as a parent are always in control. You can gradually give your children more freedom and responsibilities as they become more financially savvy.  Otly is an Amsterdam based startup with a focus on the early financial education by providing a safe financial ecosystem. Having built two dedicated apps for both parents and children, Otly has taken the first steps to realising the first banking experience for kids. Otly was founded in 2015 by FinTech veterans Lior Bornshtain and Vedran Vego. Otly has collected a number of awards and recognitions over the past two years. The most important ones are: - Alumni Rockstart Web&Mobile - 2016 - Winner #UberPITCH Europe - 2016 - Winner World Summit Awards - 2016 - Awarded SIDNfund grant - 2017 - Winner Dutch FinTech Awards - 2017",Netherlands,1.174472,,,

Refees,628942.0,"Italy, Piedmont, Biella",https://www.linkedin.com/company/refees,www.refees.it,"ReFees è una startup innovativa fintech che vuole far risparmiare commissioni agli investitori.  Spesso infatti la maggior parte delle commissioni sul risparmio gestito (fondi comuni, sicav) sono implicite, quindi non visibili dall'investitore; inoltre tali spese spesso non vengono completamente dichiarate dalla banca o intermediario finanziario, complice il conflitto di interessi che questi soggetti hanno nei confronti del cliente (essi infatti percepiscono delle commissioni di retrocessione sui prodotti collocati). L'ammontare di tali commissioni può raggiungere livelli molto alti, ben al di là di quanto il cliente si aspetta. Inoltre, la maggior parte dei prodotti a risparmio gestito attivi (che quindi sostengono di farsi pagare così cari perchè dichiarano di portare valore aggiunto al cliente) nel lungo periodo non riesce a battere il proprio indice di riferimento! Oggi esistono strumenti più efficienti a disposizione dei risparmiatori, molto più economici, che replicano fedelmente l'indice sottostante, ma che le banche propongono in misura esigua proprio per il conflitto di interessi sopra citato. L'obiettivo di reFees è far sapere al cliente, gratuitamente, quanto i suoi investimenti gli stanno costando realmente e quanto potrebbe risparmiare utilizzando strumenti più efficienti. Il servizio Premium è rivolto poi a chi volesse sapere quali strumenti utilizzare per ottenere tale risparmio. Risparmia oggi, iscrivit a reFees!",Italy,0.628942,,,

The business purpose of the FinTech company includes the issuance of the crypto token THE STONE COIN® and establishing it as a comfortable, secure and modern form of payment.  Therefore THE STONE COIN AG partners up with international projects that will increase the use of THE STONE COIN and give it instant utility.  The business idea of the company is to combine the flexibility of a crypto currency with the security of a European real estate portfolio. THE STONE COIN® is a blockchain-based ERC20 payment token / currency token. THE STONE COIN® is thus based on the decentralized Ethereum Blockchain. The concept and character of THE STONE COIN® is classified as a license-free payment token. It can be used as a means of payment at appropriate acceptance points and as a means of payment by direct transfer from Wallet to Wallet. It is available nest to Bitcoin on ATMs in Austria and soon in Switzerland, too. Furthermore it is the key currency at the charity portal REAL WORLD INSPIRE where it enables the transfer and delivery of donations to small and medium NGOs around the world. The listing of THE STONE COIN® on crypto exchanges like LATOKEN, ExMarkets, BitInka and Livecoin enables the trading (purchase and sale) of the token. The supervisory authority FMA qualified THE STONE COIN® without restrictions as a license-free pure payment token. THE STONE COIN® is therefore neither a security token nor an asset (backed) token. The company has thus received approval from the FMA for its business activities so that THE STONE COIN® can be fully issued, sold and used as a means of payment. THE STONE COIN® is the first payment token launched in Liechtenstein and also the first real estate-based payment token in the DACH region.
