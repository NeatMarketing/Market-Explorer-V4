Our story starts in 1818 when Thomas Heiton set up business in Dublin as a coal importer and distributor meeting the needs of the growing city. In the early 1900s the business diversified, adding a sector specialising in iron products, and from the 1960s onwards, additional products such as timber and plumbing products were added. Our Chadwicks business was founded in 1902 by William Thomas Chadwick at Talbot Place, Dublin, to supply builders' merchants and the major building contractors with cement and plaster produced in Ireland and abroad. During this time all deliveries to Chadwicks' customers throughout Dublin City and County were by horse drawn vehicles. In the early days the firm owned three horses and carts, but as business increased they added a fourth horse and cart and employed another driver! In the '50s the business expaned, moving to bigger premises in Walkinstown and adding new lines such as fire clay to its range of building products. Further expansion took place in the '60s and in 1967 the company opened its first branch outside Dublin, in Kilkenny. Today, Chadwicks is Ireland's leading Builders Merchants and Home Improvement Specialist, offering customers a huge range of timber, building materials and home improvement supplies including plumbing and heating products.

The Viking Arm is the first of a planned product range of patented precision hand tools, all built with our ingenious combination of innovation and high build quality.  Our business strategy is to stay focused on the path that cultivates our passion for innovation, keeps our product desirable and appreciated and strengthens and differentiates the Viking Arm brand qualities – innovative and lasting design, superior craftsmanship, creativity and an intimate understanding of the professional craftsman’s needs.

In the 1990s the company expanded its range to include wooden and laminate flooring and formed a vital cooperation with Keter Plastics. The company further expanded its business, opening a showroom in Paphos. A subsidiary company in Larnaca was also established in 2002. The same year there was a division of operations and PK Trading House Ltd was founded, distributing DIY items and offering a wide range of plastic storage solutions, such as plastic sheds, cabinets and cushion boxes. In the following years the company has enhanced its product range, particularly decorative materials, and grew significantly, forming collaborations with big international companies. Most notably with Hafele in 2017 and Corian in 2018, becoming the exclusive distributor in Cyprus for both brands. In 2019, we opened the first Hafele Partner Shop in Cyprus, in our showroom in Limassol.

Driller Queens,3121400.0,"Germany, Berlin, Berlin",https://www.linkedin.com/company/drillerqueens,www.drillerqueens.com,"Like most legacy industries the handyman industry was designed by men, for men - which (whilst deeply problematic), was accepted 60 years ago.  Now the term ‘man of the house’ is thankfully fading into obscurity and women control 80% of global consumer spending (90% in home improvements). But yet the industry is still wildly underserving its majority market. There’s no scarcity of work, but there is a huge deficit of skilled craftspeople. That’s why it takes 6 weeks for a handyman to come to your house, say he doesn’t have the right tools, charge you 100€ and leave. Unsurprisingly, when employment opportunities are only accessible to half the population - standards fall. As customers, we’ve universally accepted such poor standards that if we’re not scammed or sexually harassed, then we consider this an awesome service. In an industry where you’re not just in someone’s home, you’re in their bathroom, in their bedroom, you’re moving their things around and using loud tools - trust, communication, accountability and safety should be at the forefront.
