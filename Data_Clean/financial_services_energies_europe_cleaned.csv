Around 250 employees in the office and in the field as well as well over 3.000 sales partners for technical customer service provide advice on all questions relating to off-grid gas supply. In addition to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG), PRIMAGAS is the only German energy supplier to offer its customers biogenic LPG (Futuria propane). Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) provides the benefits of gas supply wherever there is no connection to the natural gas grid. It is stored in above-ground or buried tanks directly on site. LPG emits around 15 percent less CO2 than heating oil. Hardly any soot or particulate matter is released during combustion. The energy source evaporates without residue and can even be used in nature and water conservation areas without any restrictions. Liquid gas can be used with all modern heating technologies such as gas condensing boiler technology or combined heat and power units (CHP) and can be combined with renewable energies. Biogenic liquefied petroleum gas: Futuria Propane Since 2018, PRIMAGAS has been the first German supplier to market the renewable energy carrier biogenic liquefied petroleum gas (Futuria Propane). Since November 1, 2020, the GEG recognizes biogenic LPG as a sustainable energy alternative for new buildings.C More information at www.primagas.de and www.futuria-propan.de .",Germany,11.908469,,,

Daarnaast werken veel energieleveranciers met lokkertjes: welkomstbonussen en kortingen die je moeten overhalen om te switchen. Al die kosten moeten natuurlijk wel terugverdiend worden, en jij mag raden wie de rekening daarvoor betaalt. Bij easyEnergy vinden we dat onrechtvaardig en doen we het anders. Revolutionair anders.

Het grote verschil is echter dat easyEnergy deze beursprijs één-op-één doorgeeft aan al haar klanten, zonder verborgen kosten, nu én in de toekomst.

Al na enkele dagen raakt het lichaam in ketose en start de vetverbranding.   Het Cambridge dieet is ontwikkeld aan de universiteit van Cambridge. Doctor Allan Howard verrichtte alles bij elkaar 7 jaar onderzoek naar het dieet, in samenwerking met Addenbrook’s Hospital. Hierover verschenen diverse wetenschappelijke publicaties. De sleutel is het lage percentage koolhydraten. Omdat het lichaam minder koolhydraten binnen krijgt dan het strikt gezien nodig heeft, gaat het lichaam zelf op zoek naar zijn eigen reserves. Wanneer deze op zijn, wordt de volgende energieleverancier in het lichaam aangesproken: overtollig vet! Enkele dagen na het begin van het dieet start de vetverbranding. Dit is een medisch volkomen verantwoorde manier om snel gewicht te verliezen. Intussen krijgt het licham in de vorm van uitgebalanceerde shakes, soepen en repen, alle benodigde voedingsstoffen binnen, inclusief vitaminen en mineralen.  Het dieet is uitsluitend verkrijgbaar via een onafhankelijk Cambridge consulent. Onderzoeken wijzen uit dat het volgen van een dieet onder begeleiding effectiever is, dan zonder begeleiding.

En als nieuwe energie groen is draagt het ook bij aan ons welzijn. Wij vinden het logisch dat Groningers hierin voorop gaan, want hun welzijn staat extra onder druk. Na de gaswinning heeft de regio met de transitie naar duurzame warmte een nieuw perspectief in het vooruitzicht waar we snel werk van willen maken. Zo maken we de transitie eerlijk en veilig, als duurzame aanjager voor wijk en dorpsvernieuwing en blijvend woongeluk. Samen versnellen maakt ons koploper. Het welzijn van Groningers staat bovengemiddeld onder druk, omdat de inkomens relatief laag zijn en energierekeningen juist hoog. Gaswinning heeft in een groot deel van de provincie zijn sporen achtergelaten. Maar ook de vergrijzing is omvangrijker dan in andere delen van Nederland. Het maakt investeren in eveneens oudere woningen moeilijk of niet aantrekkelijk meer. En als het geld en de wil er wel is, dan is verduurzamen vaak lastig. Het lukt velen om verschillende redenen niet om goede stappen te maken. Daar willen we verandering in brengen. Vanuit onze visie heeft Groningen alles in huis om koploper in de transitie te zijn. Alleen door samen op te trekken pakken we problemen aan die grootschalige verduurzaming in de weg staan. Met een krachtige, gezamenlijke aanpak waardoor iedere Groninger mee kan doen. Het transitiecentrum verschaft helderheid en is een gids voor gemeenten, provincie en partners in transitie. Met een praktische en innovatieve aanpak voor de gewenste versnelling.

The cooperation with the University of Pisa also extends to this stage: the proposed solutions shall be sustained by strict technical and scientific considerations. Plants for the production of energy from renewable sources - EoT Plus aims to search for technical solutions using plants for the production of energy from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic plants (isolated or connected to the grid) or cogeneration plants, for the production of thermal energy by solar heat.  The possibility to make use of “inexhaustible” sources for self-production allows for an important reduction in the energy supply costs, whether electricity and heat.

It is a partnership of community energy organisations around Ireland working to create a sustainable energy future for their local areas.  The communities are working on saving energy, retrofits, microgeneration and developing plans for renewable energy generation.  The group grew out of Templederry, which is Ireland's first and only community owned wind farm. It is a partnership of community energy groups from Tipperary, Limerick, Galway, Mayo and Dublin and is now working to support more renewable energy projects across Ireland, and will buy electricity from small suppliers.  Last November Community Power was granted a licence to become a large utility supplier.  This is a game changer for community-owned energy generation in Ireland.  Until then Community Power had been buying and selling power between a handful of small renewable generators and a few customers.  Community Power can now take on thousands of customers and can compete on a national footing across the whole of Ireland buying and selling community owned power to and from the people of Ireland. Householders, businesses, farmers, schools etc. throughout Ireland are all being urged to switch suppliers which will in turn enable Community Power to assist other communities develop their own projects. In a market that has been closed to community and citizens for years, this means the door is now firmly open for citizens and communities to benefit from generating their own power. The company wants Ireland to run on clean renewable power, developed for people, owned by people. They recognize Ireland’s energy system is in crisis, with over 90% reliance on climate polluting fossil fuels and they are working to change that. Community Power wants the many benefits of generating renewable power to be shared by the people and communities of Ireland, and they want people to be able to afford to power their homes.",Ireland,2.443491,,,

Waarom is NederlandReview opgericht? Wij hebben zelf aardig wat slechte ervaringen (maar gelukkig ook goede) achter de rug als consument. Als wij een slechte ervaring hadden met een bedrijf, kwamen we er achter dat we dit tegen vrienden of familie vertelden, om ze te behoeden voor een eigen misstap. Maar deze bedrijven konden nog altijd gewoon precies dezelfde praktijken verrichten buiten onze vriendenkring om. Er was geen platform om heel Nederland te vertellen dat ze er vooral niet moesten kopen. Maar andersom gold natuurlijk hetzelfde. Wij zijn wel eens ontzettend goed geholpen na een storing bij onze energieleverancier, of hebben toch een flinke korting gekregen toen bleek dat de garantie van onze wasmachine net was verlopen (domme pech!).

Want we wilden ergens terecht kunnen met onze positieve en negatieve ervaringen. Wat eerst alleen in een kleine kring bekend was, kan zo heel Nederland bereiken.

The platform acts as a virtual power plant serving two main customers: 1) Real estate portfolio owners: cities, municipalities, pension funds, BlackRock, and others, can access demand response markets to sell energy flexibility, reduce consumption, and datafy assets without vendor lock-in. 2) Energy companies use the platform for sector coupling, offering automated flexibility services to their end customers in the built environment. A key component is ForeCoop, our IoT bridge (soon on www.truman.cloud), which connects energy assets directly to the cloud. It can be used standalone or integrated with the Energy Coop Platform to enable seamless real-time market participation. ForeCoop is technically advanced, competitively priced, and endorsed by one of Finland’s largest energy companies. Both the platform and ForeCoop operate fully automatically, powered by high-frequency trading bots developed with VTT. These bots perform real-time price bidding, balancing the grid and creating fair market value for buyers and sellers. With renewable energy growth comes volatility, making flexibility crucial for grid stability. Europe’s flexible energy market could reach EUR 90–120 billion by 2035, with buildings as a key source of flexibility. Currently, most building owners lack access to this market and cannot monetize their energy assets.

Naast het leveren van energieopslag, elektrificeren wij ook boten. Benieuwd wij wat voor jou kunnen betekenen? Neem gerust contact op. We zitten midden in een energietransitie. We zullen met z’n allen minder energie moeten gaan gebruiken en de energie die we gebruiken zullen we op een verantwoorde manier moeten opwekken. Daarbij komt ook nog eens de explosie van energieprijzen door de oorlog in Oekraïne.  Gelukkig zijn we in Nederland goed bezig want in 2022 zijn al ruim 1.500.000 woningen voorzien van zonnepanelen. Dit is natuurlijk geweldig alleen lopen we wel tegen een aantal beperkingen aan. Door de plaatsing van zonnepanelen, warmtepompen, elektrische verwarmingen en elektrische auto’s loopt het elektriciteitsnet tegen haar grenzen aan en komt het regelmatig voor dat de opgewekte zonne-energie niet terug te leveren is. Daar komt nog eens bij dat veel grote energieleverancier de prijzen voor het terug leveren van energie fors hebben teruggedraaid.   Gevolg is dat zonnepanelen overdag voor een schijntje energie terug leveren aan het net en in de avond voor hoge prijzen energie teruggekocht moet worden. Daarbij komt ook nog eens dat de meeste huishoudens overdag bijna geen stroom verbruiken omdat men overdag aan het werk is en pas in de avond stroom gaan verbruiken voor koken, verlichting, tv kijken, verwarmen, etc. Hoe mooi zou het zijn als je de energie die je opwekt thuis op kan slaan voor eigen gebruik.

Koncepcja optymalizacji napięcia jest prosta.  Ogólnie, rzecz biorąc moc z krajowej sieci energetycznej jest dostarczana z wyższym napięciem niż jest to konieczne ze względu na stosowane stare elektryczne sieci dystrybucyjne , które zostały zaprojektowane do pracy na wyższych poziomach napięcia, jak również dostawce energii są  zobowiązani do zapewnienia, że do wszystkich budynków dostarczane jest napięcie z właściwymi parametrami.Jeżeli budynek zasilany jest wyższym napięciem niż jest to konieczne, prawdopodobnie spowoduje to marnowanie energii, nadmierne poziomy emisji CO2 oraz wyższe niż jest to konieczne rachunki za energię elektryczną, oprócz kwestii związanych z jakością energii, zwiększonym zużyciem oraz krótszym czasem użytkowania urządzeń elektrycznych. Oprócz zmniejszenia zużycia energii, redukcji emisji dwutlenku węgla i zapewnienia oszczędności na rachunkach za energię elektryczną, optymalizacja napięcia może również poprawić jakość zasilania dzięki zrównoważeniu napięć fazowych ,filtrowaniu harmonicznych oraz napięcia przejściowego dostawców sieci.Technologie optymalizacji napięcia są zazwyczaj instalowane szeregowo między transformatorem rozdzielczym a główną rozdzielnicą niskiego napięcia, dzięki czemu wszystkie urządzenia odbiorcy mogą korzystać z optymalnego zasilania.  Istnieją dwa typy systemów optymalizacji napięcia, do których ogólnie się odwołuje przy omawianiu tego podejścia ”Sztywny” Powerstar LITE, który optymalizuje napięcie o określoną wartość i dopasowuje do profilu przychodzącego lub „Elektroniczny – dynamiczny” Powerstar MAX, który wykorzystuje inteligentne elementy sterujące w celu optymalizacji napięcia i utrzymania go na stałym poziomie. W przypadku większych obiektów, na których pracują własne infrastruktury WN/NN, po stronie WN można zainstalować system Powerstar HV MAX, aby poprawić problemy z zasilaniem źródłowym poprzez wymianę aktualnego transformatora WN na transformator z super niskimi stratami amorficznymi rdzenia i zintegrowanie go z technologią optymalizacji napięcia.

L’idea di base è stata quella di aggregare un notevole numero di clienti della T&G Sistemi, oggi Electric Power, azienda leader nel settore elettrico dove lavorarono alcuni membri del Team, al fine di perseguire il motto “l’unione fa la forza” per poter spuntare ottimi prezzi e garanzie contrattuali. Dal 1º luglio 2004 tale fascia si è allargata ulteriormente permettendo a tutti i possessori di partita IVA di poter accedere al Libero Mercato. L'ultima barriera alla liberalizzazione è caduta il 1º luglio 2007 quando anche per le utenze domestiche è stato aperto il mercato. Il crescente numero di aziende che hanno voluto partecipare al gruppo d’acquisto ha portato nel 2008 la nascita del Consorzio Energia 2000. Ad oggi gestisce la quantità di energia consumata da circa 25.000 famiglie italiane. Nel 2016 sono uscite le prime notizie sul termine del mercato di Maggior Tutela e arrivano i primi contatti. A gennaio 2017 il Team ha iniziato a porre le basi su come affrontare la chiusura del Servizio di Maggior Tutela e su come creare il primo grande Gruppo d’Acquisto per clienti domestici e piccole imprese. Il 4 agosto 2017, dopo due anni, 4 mesi e due giorni, il Senato ha dato la fiducia al Governo approvando il Ddl Concorrenza, che sancisce la fine del Mercato di Maggior Tutela a partire da luglio 2019. Tutti i clienti residenziali saranno sul Mercato Libero e dovranno scegliere il loro fornitore di energia elettrica. Dal mese di Novembre 2017 è online la prima versione del sito internet www.grupacq.energy che si occupa di gestire al meglio il primo Gruppo d’Acquisto Energetico per piccoli consumatori.",Italy,0.497436,,,

Airtight,107827.0,"Norway, Oslo, Oslo, 21 Gaustadalléen, 0349",https://www.linkedin.com/company/venturigo-as,,"Five per cent of global energy consumption is lost to air leaking from buildings. Airtight eliminates the waste. Global energy consumption has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades – especially in emerging markets. Buildings are responsible for about a third of all energy consumed in the world, with heating and cooling accounting for half of that consumption. With all the energy spent on heating and cooling buildings, however, as much as 25 per cent is wasted on air leakage. This equals an annual waste of USD 500 billion. Airtight has developed a solution for establishing a detailed “leakage signature” for individual buildings. The signature is a comprehensive analysis of energy waste. Taking the leakage signature as a starting point, Airtight uses real-time monitoring and machine learning to recommend adjustments to heating and cooling systems. This way, Airtight ensures that each centimetre of a building is fine-tuned to minimise energy waste. By pooling data from large numbers of both leaky and non-leaky buildings, Airtight is moreover able to generate in-depth insight to benefit all its customers. The Airtight system lowers energy bills, improves indoor air quality and increases the lifespan of a building. If Airtight were implemented in every building across the globe, the current annual waste of USD 500 billion would be halved. Additionally, energy use would be cut by 2.5 per cent and greenhouse gas emissions cut by 2 per cent. The International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identify building airtightness as one of the most cost-efficient ways to cut energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. In the EU alone, there is 25 billion square metres of air-conditioned building space that needs to be made airtight. Airtight is a Norwegian start-up based at StartupLab in Oslo. Its solution has been awarded the Seal of Excellence under the EU’s Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Phase 2.",Norway,0.107827,,,
