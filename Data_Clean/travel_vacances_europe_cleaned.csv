Allt sedan starten i september 1979 har vi inriktat oss på att samarbeta med dem som gör skillnad i världen.   Startskottet var familjen som skulle ut och arbeta i Cochabamba och vi hittade en bra resa till ett bra pris. Detta spred sig sedan inom missionärs- och biståndskretsar och vi kom att bygga upp en kompetens runt biståndsdestinationer, många av dem i Afrika. Tack vare att fler och fler av dessa olika organisationer började samarbeta med oss så kom vi i kontakt med nätverket Raptim, vars syfte var att främja detta resande. Vi blev en del av Raptim och fick så småningom rättigheterna för hela Norden vilket gav oss specialavtal med alla stora flygbolag.

Until then, there was no such thing. So we have been real explorers for almost 30 years! Swan Expeditions’ Tall Ships sail to unique destinations. What exactly makes a destination so special? If you can easily get to a place by car, then everyone can get there. That is not special and not the right place. If budget airliners go somewhere, you know for sure that you are in the wrong place. The exclusivity of beautiful areas often lies in their inaccessibility for the masses. The remote islands, deep bays and fjords frequented by Swan Expeditions’ Tall Ships are often only accessible by ship. You are going to experience something really extraordinary. Traveling by sailing ship is an adventure in itself, apart from the unique destinations. You are immediately away from mass tourism. A few miles from shore your cellphone range is lost and you live in the present moment again. Sailing the Tall Ship together is very special and creates a wonderful bond with the other expedition members. With that team you will travel to the remote and undiscovered nature.

Wij kennen onze rondreizen dan ook als geen ander en voorzien u graag van onze persoonlijke tips voor wat betreft routes, excursies, bezienswaardigheden en zelfs goede restaurants!  Onze reizen zijn veelal goedkoper dan bij een 'normaal' reisbureau omdat wij ze zélf direct grootschalig inkopen en organiseren. Inkoopvolume direct naar de klant zorgt ervoor dat er geen overbodige commissies aan tussenpersonen (lees: reisbureaus, boekingssites) verloren gaan, oftewel 'value for money'. Wij werken online en telefonisch, tevens brengen wij geen reisbrochures uit; alles om uw droomvakantie zo voordelig mogelijk te kunnen aanbieden!  Op onze website www.exit-reizen.nl vindt u meer dan driehonderd reizen naar de Verenigde Staten en Canada, inclusief de meest actuele prijzen. Ook kunt u alleen huurauto’s of excursies boeken. Wilt u toch liever iets anders? Geen probleem! Laat ons uw wensen weten, wij stellen graag een vrijblijvend maatwerkvoorstel voor u samen. Meer informatie?

It profiles every product and service that you offer.  It monitors what works and for whom and why.  It profiles in real time every user to help make the ideal decision to achieve the business goals you are after.   And the interaction of these product insights and revealed user profiles brings a raft of new opportunities to decide how to interact at scale.   We believe relationships are what makes us all tick. Consciously deciding how to interact is the basis for good relationships. In the pre-AI world the use of segments and personas was the best way to try and achieve a fit between users and products; the basis for commercial relationships.

Una nomina che ne riconosce e premia le spiccate qualità imprenditoriali e morali. Serietà, professionalità e competenza sono infatti le caratteristiche che sono alla base di ogni obiettivo dell'azienda.  Nei primi anni di attività, alla programmazione sul Brasile si affianca, dopo poco, quella sull’Estremo Oriente e viene costituito un reparto dedicato ai viaggi aziendali. Nel 1992 ha inizio la rotazione di voli charter su Cartagena e San Andres e, nel 1995, quella con destinazione Natal, nel Nord Est del Brasile.

Hvitserk is what the Vikings called the highest mountain on Greenland - which during the time of the Vikings used to be a part of Norway. When the toughest Vikings sailed west from Iceland on a voyage of discovery, the 3,693-metre-high mountain on the east coast of Greenland was an important landmark. After they left Iceland, they didn't see land until the white, snow-covered mountain emerged like a lighthouse in the distance. In the same way, as Hvitserk served as a ‘lighthouse’ for adventurous Vikings 1,000 years ago, the company Hvitserk now serves as a 'lighthouse' for active explorers with a desire for nature-based travel and adventures. For more than 30 years, Hvitserk has organized exciting journeys for adventurous people to all corners of the world. At the same time as we have taken people to exciting destinations abroad, we have also built up an extensive network in Norway. We have skilled guides and local partners across the length and breadth of our beautiful country. In recent years, more and more Norwegian and foreign guests have joined us on trips to unique Norwegian nature experiences! We also have extensive experience in extreme trips and demanding logistics. Hvitserk was the first Norwegian operator to offer expeditions to the South Pole, and no other Scandinavian tour operator has accompanied as many guests as we have on skiing expeditions to the Antarctic. No other tour operator in the world has accompanied as many guests on skiing expeditions across the inland ice of Greenland, and we have organized several skiing trips to the Arctic, and climbing expeditions to the peaks of the Himalayas.",Norway,2.303596,,,

Ad oggi conta 320 Agenzie partner, con un rapporto esclusivo, distribuite nel mezzogiorno d'Italia. Nel 2015 Achille Lauro Netravel s.r.l. viene fondata per sviluppare business nel comparto del mercato turistico italiano ed internazionale. L’ingresso nel settore è avvenuto indirizzando gli investimenti nella creazione di sinergie e modelli economici che ponessero in relazione la piccola impresa turistica, il territorio di appartenenza e i grandi operatori turistici.  Si è consolidato, quindi, uno schema operativo costruito attorno ad una canalizzazione commerciale, capace di redistribuire sulla rete delle imprese un’ampia offerta di prodotto, in grado di intercettare la propensione all’acquisto da parte del cliente finale grazie alle attitudini peculiari dell’agente di vendita nella specifica area geografica.  L’alimentazione della produzione di offerta è stata, quindi, supportata dall’instaurarsi di un rapporto bidirezionale tra unità centrale ed unità periferica in cui, anche quest’ultima, ha partecipato immettendo nell’ampio canale di vendita il prodotto turistico costruito con la sapienza di chi ha piena conoscenza del proprio territorio. Questa dinamica ha favorito l’alto gradimento da parte della clientela che ha ben risposto individuando in queste tipologie di offerta degli aspetti qualitativi di autenticità e di originalità che raramente sono presenti nei cataloghi degli operatori turistici leader di mercato.  Agenzia per Amica si connota come Network di Agenzie di Viaggio (AdV). Con le AdV si stipulano accordi di rete esclusivi in modo che queste ultime possano avvantaggiarsi di eccellenti condizioni commerciali con i Tour Operator, sistemi di trasporto Aereo, Treni, autobus, autonoleggi, assicurazioni, programmi di escursione, crociere e biglietteria navale.",Italy,2.303596,,,

Il sogno era quello di fondere il lavoro con la passione, e fare delle passioni un lavoro; il sogno di tutti non è d’altra parte passare più tempo possibile a fare le cose che amiamo fare, e buttare meno tempo possibile per le cose che “dobbiamo” fare…? Basta solo capire cosa amiamo, cosa ci piace fare, cosa non ci peserà mai… e qui ognuno dice la sua… Personalmente? Viaggiare, vedere posti nuovi, conoscere sempre gente nuova, venire a contatto con culture diverse, talvolta opposte, avere un mare di amici, giocare a calcio, guardare il calcio, fare sport in generale, stare il più possibile a contatto con la natura, sciare, prendere il sole, fare l’amore, fare teatro, andare a teatro… E’ questo che rispondiamo a chi chiede cos’è il Club Magellano, viaggi, raduni, tornei, feste, cene, teatro, un ritrovo con amici, e tutto quello che ci verrà in mente di fare domattina al nostro risveglio… un Club di sognatori. Possiamo dire che quel sogno è diventato una realtà affermata nel panorama turistico nazionale, grazie infatti agli oltre 30.000 clienti all’anno Club Magellano copre un ruolo da assoluto protagonista nel panorama dei Tour Operator specializzati in viaggi in bus e gruppi.

This experience lasted about 4 years and allowed me to get an idea of how the tourist market was organized in Italy. So in 1982 I decided to open a travel agency on my own in Cernusco sul Naviglio. Those years were formidable for tourism, travel agents were the only way to book a flight, a train, or any other tourist service. Practically, the technology was still primitive: no computers or fax, only the telephone and in some agencies, like our, at most the teletype. Year after year we managed to build and consolidate a good reputation in our neighborhood, I remember the long queues of clients who formed in the agency in those years, mainly in Spring and before of  Holidays season,  We were important to customers but also to our suppliers, such as airlines or tour operators. Obviously, year after year with the advent of electronics, our work became increasingly less manual and more digital.  Up to these days, when I can even just with my smartphone in few minutes book and issue air tickets, or book a hotel or a car and then send everything by email to my client. It has been a fantastic experience to have gone through all these changes in more than 40 years of being a business travel agent. And it's not over yet!",Italy,1.750629,,,

Secondly, we assist local communities at destinations with the development of small-scale tourism activities that contribute towards poverty alleviation and nature conservation. We are open to work together with different stakeholders, like governments, tour operators, NGOs and local communities, to achieve this goal.

Together with other hill-tribes from Myanmar, they were settled in refugee camps along the border. The Thai government brought them over to villages to act as a tourist attraction. As they are not Thai citizens, their freedom of movement is conﬁned to the villages. Fair Tourism wants to assist these communities to make the transition towards community-based tourism (CBT).

Teorema Tour,1665792.0,"Italy, Lombardy, Milan, 1 Largo Augusto, 20122",https://www.linkedin.com/company/teorema-tour,www.teorematour.it,"20 dicembre 1980 con la stampa del catalogo capodanno 80-81 nasce nel panorama turistico italiano un nuovo tour operator: Teorema Tour S.p.A.  Fondata nel 1980 con l’obiettivo strategico è di programmare destinazioni con altissima potenzialità e continuità di mercato rinunciando a rincorrere mode o comportamenti forse più economicamente premianti nel breve termine ma di dubbia prospettiva e fedeltà, creando prodotti destinati ai diversi segmenti del middle market italiano offrendo il migliore rapporto qualità/prezzo possibile. Ciò ha significato operare in un contesto di mercato articolato e difficile, presidiato dalla più significativa e forte concorrenza italiana, accettare le sue sfide commerciali e di immagine, proporre prodotti innovativi con maggiore valore aggiunto per poter guadagnare quella market share indispensabile per lo sviluppo aziendale nei tempi prefissati. Sempre nel 1984 scuote il mercato con una nuova formula Vacanza: Bambini Gratis. Formula innovativa per il mercato italiano, che attrae il target famiglia e da cui tanti tour operators prenderanno spunto. Piu’ di 50.000 posti gratis per bambini in camera con 2 adulti,questa l’offerta di Teorema Tour che riserva un grande numero di posti a questa promozione. Nel 1986 rivoluziona l’impaginazione dei cataloghi inserendo la descrizione alberghiera divisa per categorie….posizione, a vostra disposizione, sistemazione, sport e divertimento; queste alcune delle categorie che in maniera innovativa, rispetto al normale standard d’impaginazione, rendono ancor più analitica ed esauriente la descrizione di ogni struttura. All’interno del catalogo viene inserita, inoltre, l’opinione del tour operator stesso, che vuole indirizzare nella struttura più idonea il lettore, e la media delle valutazioni pervenuta dai clienti tramite il questionario allegato ai documenti di viaggio. In tal maniera, si forniscono nel catalogo indicazioni più ampie indirizzando i clienti nella struttura che più si addice alle loro esigenze. Un concetto rivoluzionario che prende in considerazione l’opinione dei clienti per la scelta degli alberghi e nell’elaborazione di nuovi programmi. Nel 1988 Teorema Tour per prima in Italia ha lanciato la formula “prenota in anticipo e paghi meno”. Una moda largamente copiata, ma solo Teorema Tour vi garantisce il miglior rapporto qualità/prezzo. Una grande opportunità per i clienti sensibili al risparmio e per vacanzieri esperti.  Uno sviluppo aziendale che ha reso indispensabile il consolidamento delle strutture operative e commerciali di Teorema Tour computerizzando tutte le funzioni aziendali, automatizzando i nostri principali uffici esteri, creando centri di Assistenza esteri esclusivi, regionalizzando il prodotto Teorema Tour, organizzando catene charter dai principali aeroporti italiani, qualificando ancor più l’offerta turistica, aprendo proprie filiali a Bologna, Verona e Roma con booking totalmente automatizzati ed una struttura di promo-vendite/assistenza diretta. Il mercato italiano ha premiato questa politica consentendo a Teorema Tour di collocarsi tra i primi operatori sul mercato. Questo successo ha consentito a Teorema Tour di anticipare gli investimenti previsti nei suoi piani di sviluppo creando nel 1993 una struttura di gestione alberghiera denominata “BLU CLUB” per offrire al mercato prodotti esclusivi alle esigenze del cliente italiano.  Nel 1999 annette al gruppo il tour operator Simply Travel. Specializzato in mete a lungo raggio create su misura per il cliente. Mete come Oriente, Australia, Polinesia, Stati Uniti, Sud America, etc. tali che permettono di raggiungere un target di clientela più eterogeneo.",Italy,1.665792,,,

Each accommodation requires a per rental CO2 balance from our partner Atmosfair (a greenhouse gases compensator). That's why, in addition to the presentation of selected eco-friendly accommodation and activities, we post specific blog articles regarding sustainability innovations and news (permaculture, naturo-culture, slow food, eco-construction such as the straw-bale construct...) in three languages: German, French and English.

Wir möchten, dass Ihr Geld auch dort ankommt, wo es gebraucht wird – bei der lokalen Bevölkerung. Wir lieben Afrika und hoffen, dass unsere liebsten Ecken für unsere Kunden zugänglich bleiben. Das gelingt nur, wenn die Natur geschützt und den Einheimischen geholfen wird. Dann ist es möglich, mit Ivory Tours das „echte“, unverstellte und ursprüngliche Afrika zu erleben. Unsere Kunden erleben eindrucksvolle Landschaften, riesige Wüstengebiete und traumhafte Strände. Sie lernen stolze Stämme und Kulturen genauso kennen wie Wildtiere in ihrem natürlichen Lebensraum. Wir haben alle Ziele, die wir anbieten, auch selbst bereist und können so aus der Vielfalt, die der afrikanische Kontinent bietet, die spannendsten Regionen auswählen.  Ivory Tours wurde 1986 von Rainer Lösel, einem langjährigen Afrika-Kenner, an der Elfenbeinküste gegründet. Lange bot Ivory Tours als einer der wenigen Reiseanbieter Reisen in die eher unbekannten Länder West- und Zentralafrikas an.

Dopo aver venduto per anni case mobili nuove ai Tour Operator europei per conto della ditta Shelbox, Lombardi ha iniziato a comprare gli stock delle loro case mobili usate e a proporle ai suoi clienti italiani, sia campeggi che privati.  Provenendo da flotte di aziende prestigiose, spesso di Tour Operator o di grandi campeggi, le nostre case mobili sono, quindi, state realizzate da aziende di primaria importanza (SHELBOX, WILLERBY, IRM, O’HARA, SUNROLLER) e sono spesso ricche di accessori che quasi mai figurano nella dotazione standard delle case mobili, inoltre, il nome prestigioso delle aziende che le utilizzavano garantisce che fino all’ultimo giorno avevano ricevuto tutta la manutenzione necessaria per essere all’altezza dei loro standard di qualità. Siamo molto competitivi nelle forniture di grossi stock a campeggi o rivenditori sia italiani che esteri e siamo in grado di far partire le case direttamente dai campeggi in cui ritiriamo, accompagnando in questo caso il cliente sul posto e permettendogli di scegliere le case mobili che gli saranno poi inviate. Abbiamo anche un’ottima organizzazione logistica, grazie alla quale siamo in condizione di consegnare in tutta Italia, isole comprese, a costi competitivi, senza che il nostro cliente debba preoccuparsi di predisporre un trasporto eccezionale. Inoltre, avendo spesso disponibilità di vari modelli in diversi campeggi, è nostra cura suggerire al cliente le soluzioni più vicine al luogo di destinazione e quindi più convenienti sul piano economico. Per tutte queste ragioni la nostra azienda cresce ogni anno, sia vantando un forte indice di fedeltà da parte dei nostri clienti storici, sia acquisendone continuamente di nuovi, spesso grazie al semplice passaparola partito da persone che si sono servite da noi. http://www.casemobilioccasione.com/",Italy,1.342393,,,

Peru is de bakermat van de Inca cultuur en is vooral bekend als het land van de Inca’s. Maar Peru heeft veel meer te bieden. Ook vóór de Inca tijd werd Peru al gekenmerkt door een rijke culturele geschiedenis. En naast een rijke culturele historie heeft Peru veel natuurschoon. Het is één van de meest landschappelijk gevarieerde landen die u kunt bezoeken. Het heeft drie landschappelijke zones: De kust (La Costa), het hooggebergte (La Sierra) en het tropisch regenwoud (La Selva). Alle drie worden gekenmerkt door hun eigen specifieke schoonheid. Onze individuele rondreizen zijn dan ook een mix van cultuur en natuur en u kunt daarbij zelf de accenten aanbrengen door de keuze van de rondreis. Wij hebben actieve, avontuurlijke en ontspannende rondreizen. Ook vindt u op onze website de mogelijkheid om uw eigen rondreis samen te stellen met de hier aanwezige bouwstenen.

WILI SLOVAKIA S.r.o.,1269770.0,Slovakia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wili-holding,www.wilislovakia.sk,"V oblasti cestovného ruchu sa pohybujeme už od roku 1992, kedy naša spoločnosť vznikla. Založil ju bývalý podpredseda Národnej rady Slovenskej republiky, úspešný podnikateľ, JUDr. Viliam Veteška, ktorý sa stal v roku 1998 držiteľom Zlatého podnikateľského biatecu a v rokoch 1998 a 1999 bol Prominentom ekonomiky Slovenskej republiky. S pôvodným zámerom vytvorenia prvej holdingovej spoločnosti cestovného ruchu bol pilierom spoločnosti Hotel WILI v Púchove, ktorý sa v roku 2004 stal Hotelom roka. Hostili sme osobnosti z celého sveta zo spoločenskej, kultúrnej, ale aj športovej oblasti. Získali sme bohaté cateringové skúsenosti v zahraničí i na Slovensku. Naše, vo svojej dobe najmodernejšie hotelové wellness centrum na Slovensku, otvárali úspešní hráči NHL Pavol Demitra, Rastislav Pavlikovský a Richard Zedník. A päť rokov sme boli domovom pre Slovenskú hokejovú reprezentáciu do 20 rokov. Súčasťou holdingu sa neskôr stali spoločnosti na prenájom áut, sprievodcovských služieb, obchodu, ale aj cestovná kancelária WILI Travel, ktorá sa starala nielen o obsadzovanie vlastných hotelových kapacít, ale organizovala pobyty zahraničných hostí na Slovensku (lyžovačky, športové sústredenia, detské tábory). Mali sme aj 2 vlastné zastúpenia v zahraničí. Ďalším hotelom v našej sieti bol Hotel WILI v Tatranskej Lomnici (bývalý hotel Družba), ktorý v roku 2006 prešiel rozsiahlou rekonštrukciou a stal sa z neho nádherný apartmánový dom, kde 80% apartmánov vlastnia súkromné osoby a naša spoločnosť prenajíma zvyšných 20%, ako WILI TATRY. Vďaka tomu, že nás to vždy tiahlo do prírody, v roku 1999 vznikol nápad postaviť a prevádzkovať chaty v nádhernom prostredí Veľkej Fatry, v Liptovských Revúcach. Tie sú, dnes už ako WILI HUNTER, veľmi obľúbené aj pre možnosť pozorovania medveďov v ich prirodzenom prostredí. V rovnakom roku ako sme previedli Hotel WILI v Púchove (2010), sa súčasťou našej holdingovej spoločnosti stala vila WILI ROYAL v Belušských Slatinách, ktorú sme do tej doby prenajímali. Tenisový kurt (v dnešnej dobe multifunkčné ihrisko) pôvodne otváral slovenský olympionik Miloš Mečíř, spolu s ďalšími úspešnými slovenskými tenistami. Začiatkom roka 2018 sa turizmové aktivity spoločnosti (prenájom apartmánov WILI TATRY a chát WILI HUNTER) pretransferovali na spoločnosť WILI SLOVAKIA s.r.o. Náplňou tejto spoločnosti je aj prenájom kancelárskych priestorov v Púchove a správcovské úkony v Tatranskej Lomnici. Sídlo spoločnosti WILI SLOVAKIA s.r.o. je v súčasnej dobe v Púchove.",Slovakia,1.26977,,,

Do you have a well-developed distribution strategy that reaches out to relevant markets and segments? -Are you looking for more resources when it comes to hands-on sales management or revenue strategy? -Do you need help to spread commercial understanding throughout the whole organization? -How can the operations team assist in driving profitability? As the industry has developed and competition has become more fierce, we have developed a way of working that has proven to partly drive strong commercial results, but also spread a commercial understanding and commitment through the organization's various departments. The Scandinavian hospitality industry is traditionally not used to working with consultants, this mainly due to the lack of supply and knowledge within commercial understanding. From our years of experience within all different departments in the industry we have realized that there is a need of extra resources and competence in this field. This has lead us to create Côtel Hospitality, where we help other organizations reach their goals. And most importantly understanding the benefits of what setting a distinct commercial strategy will do to your bottom line. Together we can identify challenges and outline possibilities, but nevertheless we also want to help get the work done and evaluate the outcome.

A really unique idea at the time, since there was nothing like it in Greece. Today, its the biggest community of active travel bloggers in Greece and through actions on its official website and social media accounts the community tries to achieve its goals. As a community they have two main goals. The first one, is to inspire Greek travelers to try new experiences, adventures or activities and discover new aspects of themselves. The second goal of the Travelvibe community is to help tourism professionals get closer at a very promising market – the travel bloggers’ market – that has fresh ideas, is heavily involved in social media and active blogging and is able to help the entire industry, since they use word of mouth to communicate with their audience. In its first year of operation, Travelvibe has managed to build a strong team of more than 70 people including travel bloggers, vloggers, instagrammers, photographers and videographers, collaborate with travel agencies and hotels, participate in projects to promote a great idea and all of the above without ever loosing sight of its main goal…  discovering new places and new spots throughout the world! It’s worth mentioning that all effort is voluntary. There is no company involved supporting the team financially or in any other way or trying to make profit out of it. Travelvibe is a group of people trying to communicate their passion for travel alongside with tips and useful information for each location they visit. Some have even traveled all the way to Everest Base Camp, Mexico and exotic islands, such as Sentosa, captured their great adventure and shared their extraordinary experience. On Travelvibe’s official website, one can find over 400 travel stories whilst on its social media one can really feel the travel vibes!

Our mission While we want people to continue to enjoy the benefits of travel, we believe that awareness of the environmental footprint of travel today is the first step toward reducing emissions in the future. The earth is warming rapidly. Emissions from air travel alone account for about 3.5% of total global warming. The travel industry needs to change, and we need to travel more consciously, because if we continue to emit current levels of greenhouse gasses, we will exceed the 1.5℃ global warming limit agreed to in the 2015 Paris Agreement, and we will do so in a serious way. The first step in this journey is to educate people about the climate impacts of different travel choices. The second step is to empower them to reduce and offset those impacts with reliable, proven tools. There is no room for greenwashing - talking openly about emissions is much better than avoiding discussion! Our goal is to help airline and travel agency customers understand travel-related emissions and how to reduce them, without fooling them into thinking that the €5 they pay for carbon offsets will offset the environmental damage of a long-haul flight. We are committed to minimizing the harmful impacts of travel and pushing for better supply of and demand for low-emission travel products.

Every traveler one member attracts can become a customer for another through our lead-pooling network. Together, we build marketing equity, reduce acquisition costs, and finally keep ownership of our audiences, without commissions, unreasonable ad-spend or middlemen. Travel is a lifetime journey.

Siam Viaggi,832896.0,"Italy, Lombardy, Milan, 26 Via Pisacane, 20129",https://www.linkedin.com/company/siam-viaggi,www.siamviaggi.it,"Ciao da Simona Tonali e Paolo Aloe, titolari del Tour Operator Siam Viaggi. Dal 2013 ci dedichiamo a studiare programmi e percorsi di viaggio personalizzati, per aiutare i nostri clienti a vivere esperienze esclusive e davvero appaganti, create per soddisfare solo le loro esigenze ed aspettative individuali. Ma, per dirla tutta, non è stato sempre così. All’inizio della nostra attività eravamo in tutto e per tutto un’agenzia di viaggi generalista, con una sede aperta al pubblico a Lecco, e trattavamo tutti i paesi e le destinazioni turistiche del mondo. Proponevamo, cioè, offerte standard e soggiorni turistici pre-confezionati dalle big company del turismo, dovunque ci fosse richiesta, senza distinzioni. Ben presto però ci siamo resi conto che operare in quel modo non era ciò che desideravamo per la nostra soddisfazione e per quella dei nostri clienti. Volevamo di più a livello professionale. Occuparci di tutto un po’, infatti, non ci permetteva di trasmettere reale valore alle persone e nemmeno di mettere a frutto le nostre conoscenze ed esperienze dirette sui territori, vissuti come appassionati viaggiatori, ancor prima che come professionisti del settore turistico. Così abbiamo chiuso per sempre l’Agenzia Viaggi su strada ed aperto un ufficio come Tour Operator con l’obiettivo di ideare e costruire da zero i viaggi solo in specifiche aree del mondo, creando anche il nostro primo brand Travel Australia (oggi Travel Oceania). Sono le nazioni e i paesi che amiamo di più e che abbiamo racchiuso all’interno dei nostri 4 Brand: Travel Oceania, Travel North America e Travel South Africa, Travel Japko. Siamo certi di poter fare la differenza consigliando i nostri clienti, perché si tratta di territori in cui abbiamo viaggiato innumerevoli volte in passato e che continuiamo a esplorare ogni anno senza fermarci, allo scopo di toccare con mano.",Italy,0.832896,,,

La nostra proposta di affiliazione si rivolge principalmente a Start up, ma di recente è stata creata anche la formula “Globitalia Friends” che consente l’adesione al gruppo anche ad agenzie già consolidate. Questo ci permette – fra le altre cose – di vantare fatturati più alti nei confronti dei tour operator, ottenendo così migliori condizioni di mercato. A oggi, possiamo dunque affermare senza esitazioni che il Network GLOBITALIA è uno dei pochi che riesce a garantire all’affiliato il conseguimento di obiettivi concreti in un tempo ragionevole, trasformando un sogno – quello di aprire un’agenzia di viaggi – in un’attività divertente e redditizia. Oltre al fatto che l’affiliato è dotato di una propria licenza e dunque è autonomo e indipendente. Il sistema del franchising offre, infatti, numerosi vantaggi per i potenziali franchisee, fra i quali:       Una maggiore possibilità di successo aziendale;     La certezza di utilizzare sistemi operativi testati;     Il potere di acquisto di una grande organizzazione;     La sinergia del gruppo e l’interazione con altri franchisee;     Programmi di formazione, training e supporto;     Un nome ed un marchio riconosciuto dai fornitori e dai clienti",Italy,0.779725,,,

Using her years of living in Asia and her hospitality expertise, she founded a luxury tour operator, specialising in tailor-made journeys to Southeast Asia. Though initially focused on golfing clientele, over the years Pan Asia has evolved to provide luxury, bespoke services to the upper crust of Slovakia, accommodating them in boutique properties with signature flair, providing exceptional personal guides, and ensuring their journeys are flawless from start to finish. These unique qualities allow us to proudly count successful entrepreneurs, notable politicians, and showbusiness personalities among our clients. The key factor that differentiates Pan Asia from other operators is our attention to detail and devotion to perfection. Mrs Misurova travels to Southeast Asia several times a year, searching for new properties and destinations that meet her precise requirements for exceptionality. Instead of working with local agents and receiving a haphazard collection of resorts, Pan Asia carefully researches and personally visits each property we work with. After the contract rates are agreed, we keep in close contact with the resort, ensuring that our high standards are maintained. Our guides are similarly carefully selected. While other operators in Slovakia send Slovak delegates, we believe that nobody can know a country better than a local. Personally vetted by Mrs Misurova, they see the little-known paths and stories. Given comprehensive information on the clients, our guides are able to fully accommodate all of their needs and adjust the tour to fit their personalities. This is all part of our desire for every one of our clients to have a unique experience. Nurtured from the seed of a single idea, working with 6 resorts in Malaysia in 2004, the company has grown to promoting eleven countries and more than 90 properties across Southeast Asia.",Slovakia,0.761603,,,

Meanwhile all touristic destinations are likewise and it’s difficult to experience local cultures. The local population doesn’t always share in the enormous revenues.

You’ll experience local cultures, you’ll see amazing and undiscovered places and your expenses will stimulate local economies.

Begin jaren '70 heeft Tony Vetrugno, zoon van Italiaanse immigranten, een visie. Hij droomt van een vakantie in het zonnige zuiden en hij wil deze droom graag delen met vele anderen. Dat dit indruist tegen de tijdsgeest deert hem niet en op 6 januari 1972 richt hij z’n eigen reisbureau “Solmar” op. De zon en de zee klinken alvast door in de naam maar het echte werk begint nu pas. Met een aantal zelfgemaakte smalfilms en een gitaar onder de arm schuimt hij de provincie af met een heilige missie : de Limburgers een opening bieden naar de wereld. Tijdens die infoavonden legt hij de fundamenten van z’n succesverhaal. Touroperator In 1973 stampt Tony naast het reisbureau ook een touroperator uit de grond. Hierdoor zet hij met enkele andere voortrekkers het internationaal toerisme mee in de steigers in België, met Italië als een van de trekpleisters. Het levert hem een reeks nationale en internationale awards op. Hij diversifieert gaandeweg het aanbod met nieuwe formules voor families, ouderen en zakenmensen. Naast de autovakanties zet hij ook de school- en cultuurreizen en de skivakanties naar Italië op de kaart, een segment waarin Solmar vandaag nog altijd marktleider is. Maatwerk Vandaag heeft Morena de fakkel van haar vader overgenomen. Samen met haar ervaren en enthousiast team doktert ze met de glimlach de meest geschikte reisformule uit voor alle reislustige klanten. Ze gaan voor niets minder dan het beste, de pioniersrol en de waarden van Tony Vetrugno indachtig. Het bestaande aanbod schaven ze voortdurend bij want maatwerk en innovatie zitten nu eenmaal in de genen. En zo blijft Solmar in Limburg al meer dan 45 jaar lang de referentie in schoolreizen, groepsreizen en individuele reizen. Uw vakantie begint hier!",Belgium,0.54385,,,

Founder Michael Carlin was able to find many motorbike travel offers on the Internet - but there was no place to get an overview and compare. MOTOURISMO.com closes this gap in the Internet. Right from the start, MOTOURISMO.com was the largest portal for motorcycle travel, motorcycle training and motorcycle shipping. In the meantime, it continuously integrates between more than 3,000 offers from currently 80 tour operators and it is constantly growing. MOTOURISMO.com thus offers for the first time an overview of a diverse industry. Motorcyclists can find, compare and book their offers quickly and easily using a fine filter.  It was only through MOTOURISMO.com that many customers recognised the possibilities offered by the many organisers in this sector: from one-day training courses, guided road and off-road tours on their own motorcycles, to trips lasting several weeks including motorcycle transport or rental motorcycles to almost all regions of the world and in all categories - whether it be the short enduro winter escape in Southern Europe, the big Harley tour in New Zealand or the long adventure trip along the Silk Road.  Among the providers at MOTOURISMO.com are both well-known names in the industry as well as many smaller tour operators and specialty providers.",Germany,0.416448,,,

Budapest, como tal, nació en 1873 gracias a la unificación de Buda, Pest y Óbuda, pero sus orígenes se remontan a la antigua Roma.   Los primeros en aprovechar su emplazamiento a orillas del río fueron los romanos, quienes la bautizaron  como Aquincum. Después, vendrían godos, ávaros y magiares (considerados los antepasados de los  húngaros) que llegaron al mando de Arpad 896, seguidos de mongoles y turcos. Sin embargo, fueron los Habsburgo quienes,bajo el dominio austrohúngaro, en tiempos de Sissi y Francisco Jose, dieron a Budapest el carácter imperial que aún se siente pese a la destruccion casi total de la II Guerra Mundial. Igual de imperial que Viena pero mucho mas apasionada y vital. Alguien puso como ejemplo de su apasionado caracter a algunos de sus ciudadanos mas internacionales:  Zsa Zsa Gabor (apasionada por el cine), George Soros (apasionado por el dinero) y Ilona Staller, alias Cicciolina (Apasionada por... por...).

El nombre de nuestro club de viajeros, de vuestro club desde ahora mismo, es ONEIRA. El nombre nos inspira territorios oníricos, tejidos a menudo con recuerdos de viajes pasados, que retenemos en nuestra memoria. Alguien escribió “los viajes primero son sueños”. ONEIRA deriva de la traducción al griego de la palabra “sueño”. Pues no en vano la experiencia de viajar y soñar pueden ser territorios comunes.  Nos seduce muy especialmente esta cita de Guy de Maupassant: “El viaje es una puerta por donde salimos de la realidad conocida para penetrar en una realidad inexplorada que nos recuerda a los sueños” El antecedente más próximo de nuestro proyecto fue PERIPLOS. Con el equipo de PERIPLOS iniciamos una inolvidable singladura en el año de 2009, realizando y diseñando nuestro primer viaje en 2010  a la fascinante India del Norte y Nepal y hasta 2018 no hemos parado de viajar con nuestros amigos viajeros, realizando más de 40 salidas de grupo, en una evolución que nos ha llevado a ONEIRA club de viajeros. Nuestros viajes son diseñados concienzudamente con nuestro sello especial. Te presentamos viajes de grupo a tu medida, en su mayoría de gran recorrido y grandes destinos, con especial interés en las gentes,  la cultura y la naturaleza de los lugares que visitamos, prestando la mayor atención a lo que realmente el viajero demanda: vivir y sentir viajes auténticos, en el relativamente corto tiempo que invertimos en cada uno de ellos .

Trabalhei no primeiro social media team oficial da Regione Toscana para promoção oficial de turismo na Toscana no distante ano de 2009/2010 quando projetos do gênero eram uma novidade.

Incognito,248438.0,"Cyprus, Larnaka, Tochni, Agion Konstantinou Kai Elenis, 7740",https://www.linkedin.com/company/becyprus,incognitocy.com,"The shift of the UK nighttime industry in the last decade from nightclubs to festivals is both sad and exciting. For various reasons, more and more of the population are opting to go out less, and instead spend their disposable income on bigger social outings only a handful of times per year. Because of this, festivals are hot right now and new entries into the market are popping up all the time, but the fact remains that the British weather is highly unpredictable and the spaces that these events are held in -- usually a set of marquees on open brownfield land -- leave a lot to be desired. While organisers push themselves to go bigger and better with their line-ups and production each year, they remain limited in their quest by one factor: location. It is only a matter of time before people get bored of the wet and muddy field format and go in search of 'the next thing'. At Be, our aim is to become a national outbound tour operator specialising in festival-style experiences and authentic connections. We believe that setting is the single most important factor in making or breaking an event, and a true differentiator if you find the right one. Following Managing Director Luke Fisher's relocation to Cyprus in 2019 and his involvement in the local events scene this past summer, we have seen first-hand that Larnaca has some truly breathtaking spaces along the coast and is stupidly underutilised compared to the over-commercialised party town of Ayia Napa. By combining his industry contacts in the UK and knowledge of his new local area, we can be at the forefront of a movement to make Larnaca an attractive destination for parties and events. With its subtropical climate, array of coastal venues, own airport and relatively inexpensive flights from most major UK airports, it is ideally poised as a backdrop to world-class events and within easy reach of UK audiences.",Cyprus,0.248438,,,
