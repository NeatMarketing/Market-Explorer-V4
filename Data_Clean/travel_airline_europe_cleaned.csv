Reaching the Karman line (the boundary of space) is generally regarded as the first step to developing launch system technologies and serves as a good platform from which to understand the technical challenges involved in building orbital launchers, which is a field that is currently expanding exponentially.        The ongoing mission of 𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔 (Association for Space Technology and Research Applications) is to provide an opportunity for students of the University of Bremen to engineer and innovate in a capacity that complements their programs.  The Karman Project is the first project to be accepted by 𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔 and it is ASTRA’s hope that future innovative projects will follow to continue broadening the education available at the University of Bremen. The primary goal of the project is to design, build, and launch a rocket to reach an altitude of 100 km. This project shall serve as a technology demonstrator and engineering exercise to enhance the quality of education at the University of Bremen through the availability of hands-on experience for the student body and inspire the student community.  If successful, this vehicle could serve as a platform to launch future scientific payloads requiring 5-10 minutes of microgravity.",Germany,23.990426,,,

To Revolutionize Urban Mobility The history of urban mobility is strongly intertwined with the development of housing. For centuries we have succeeded in being able to support a growing number of passengers via an increasing number of transportation solutions, thus enabling us to increase the density of our cities, ultimately setting the foundation for our modern society. We strongly believe that we, to achieve the next step in this evolution, need to move into the third dimension. To achieve this goal we set out not just to create something capable of flight, but rather to create a product that is capable of bringing a premium experience to the consumer market. To Revolutionize Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAV) It is our conviction that we can bring the freedom of personal air travel to the mass market. This goal was taken with the development of the first mass-produced car and has been pursued to this day in many ideas with varying degrees of success. However, none of these ideas have yet managed to achieve actual access to the mass market. For this reason, we are pursuing the goal of achieving not only further developments in our product but in every single step that comes before and after it. To Revolutionize Industry The history of production is marked by several rapid upheavals that have fundamentally changed its face. Each of these upheavals has enabled humanity as a whole to advance into a new era of prosperity and freedom. It is now time for it to undergo fundamental change again. Our goal is to take 3D printing out of rapid prototyping and into mass production. This, in combination with a high degree of automation in production, enables us to achieve good cost efficiency in low production volumes. Also, our production can dynamically switch to new products and processes and incorporate modifications into existing products. For more of our story, visit www.muskthrust.com",Germany,5.191349,,,

Mit dieser Idee hat er gemeinsam mit seinem Team die Charterfluggesellschaft erfolgreich aufgebaut, die heute über zahlreiche zufriedene Stammkunden verfügt. Der Erfolg beruht auf einer wirtschaftlichen Flotte, die es ermöglicht, Privatflüge zu attraktiven Preisen anzubieten. Zudem ist die Flotte in der Lage, auch kleinere Regionalflughäfen anzufliegen, wodurch rund 1.200 Ziele in ganz Europa direkt erreichbar sind. Das Unternehmen operiert von zwei Basen in Nürnberg und Frankfurt Egelsbach. Für den Kunden bedeutet das: Er gelangt über Regionalflughäfen direkt und ohne Umwege an sein Ziel.

Diese Verkehrsmittel sind zwar solide, aber oft mit langen, zeitintensiven Reiseketten und unvorhersehbaren Hindernissen wie Staus oder Verspätungen verbunden. Ein Privatflugzeug hingegen bietet eine maßgeschneiderte, schnelle Alternative. Die Reisekette ist individuell, unkompliziert und deutlich kürzer – so erreichen Sie Ihr Ziel bis zu 80 % schneller als mit anderen Verkehrsmitteln.

Our disciplines vary from engineering to computer sciences, from physics to biomedical sciences, and from bachelors to PhDs. We are developing the next generation of quantum magnetic field sensors based on NV centers in diamond for space applications. While advancing technology motivates us to push forward, our main focus is on personal growth and inspiring the next generations of scientists and engineers to join challenging fields of space and quantum research. This project series started in 2015 with a REXUS/BEXUS stratospheric balloon experiment - OSCAR-BEXUS - a first step taking NV based magnetometers out of the lab, for a viability study, followed by OSCAR-QLITE in 2017/2018. In 2020 OSCAR-QUBE was selected for the ESA Academy “Orbit Your Thesis!” program. That allowed us to test our sensor aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for a length of ten months.  Currently, we are developing the next iteration of our sensor OSCAR-QUBE+ to be tested during Ariane 6 maiden flight as a scientific payload for the ESA YPSat mission. On top of that, our OSCAR-PINQ project got selected for the ESA Academy Experiments - Space Rider programme. We gained a lot of experience from all these projects, while optimizing the NV-based quantum sensing technology. That is why we are working hard to further optimize our magnetometers and we are looking for next challenges to test our devices in the space environment.",Belgium,4.392979,,,

Iwiation,3751092.0,"Germany, Bavaria, Munich",https://www.linkedin.com/company/iwiation,www.iwiation.com,"iwiation GmbH provides expert assessments in the area of accident reconstruction and visualisation.  Witness and video footage can be essential, if flight data is not available or radar data is not complete / insufficient accuracy due to terrain reflection.  The world-wide unique method called Immersive-Witness-Interview (iwi®) was developed to reconstruct missing data based on eyewitness statements and / or video information for flight path reconstruction. Flight path and aircraft attitude data can be reconstructed based on available witness / video information. The reconstructed accident scenario can become quickly complex and visualization can be essential to provide material for documentation, analysis and explanation, how the accident occurred. Further, more and more accidents are related to human factors. Therefore a photorealistic real-time visualization can support to better understand the reconstructed accident scenario from different perspectives. Root causes like weather conditions, mission, reaction time, diversion, etc. can be analyzed with the developed Virtual-Reality environment. To do so, the reconstructed flight path and the overall accident scenario including terrain, aircraft geometry and cockpit instrumentation are transferred into Virtual-Reality, providing a real-time and photorealistic rendering. This can be used by authorities during the analysis of the accident sequence and dedicated scenes can be documented in the final report. The integrated eyetracking technology allows detailed human factor analysis of accident sequence playback. The results can be used by operators for lessons learned training to further improve aviation safety.",Germany,3.751092,,,

Kształcą także kadry dla lotnictwa, kierując uczelniami wyższymi i wykładając na nich. Wprowadzają w nich innowacyjne rozwiązania, tworzą nowe kierunki studiów.  Są badaczami prawa lotniczego, pracują przy jego tworzeniu. Kierują także instytucjami rządowymi związanymi z lotnictwem. Inne aktywnie działają na rzecz branży lotniczej, tworzą inicjatywy popularyzujące historię lotnictwa. Sukcesy kobiet w branży lotniczej oraz ich działania na jej rzecz skłoniły nas do powołania „Women for Aviation. Stowarzyszenia Kobiet dla Lotnictwa”.

In order to prevent peak workload conditions, automation will increase for all pilots’ tasks: therefore, there is a need to frame the human-machine interaction in terms of partnership, building capacity in machines to better understand humans, and in people to engage collaboratively with them. In this context, the overall objective of HARVIS project is to identify how cognitive computing algorithms, implemented in a digital assistant, could support the decision making of a single pilot in complex situation. The project will produce a roadmap to help the EU and Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking orient the research and development in the next decade.",Belgium,2.64365,,,

Currently, over 20 students specializing in various engineering fields are working to get PW-Sat3 ready for launching in 2023.  The  mission  plan  aims  to  test  the  following  subsystems developed  by Association members: 1. Cold-gas propulsion–The growing number of satellite constellations causes high demand for propulsion systems on the CubeSat market. Following this trend, our student team designed a butane propulsion system with an additional heating chamber and membrane for phase separation. According to the mission plan, the device will perform orbit correction and deorbit manoeuvres to address the collision risk and space debris problems.  2. Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) –Essential to performing manoeuvres with the cold-gas propulsion. We are developing our own pointing algorithms including SIL/HIL simulation solutions based on COTS components. We are also considering testing Earth Horizon Sensors based on low-res IR matrices as the secondary ADCS experiment.  3.

Amonyx ApS,2086124.0,Denmark,https://www.linkedin.com/company/amonyx,www.amonyx.com,"At Amonyx we take pride in creating contemporary wing technology capable of unique high lift and long range for any fixed winged or rotary aircraft, while at the same time achieving CO2 and fuel cost savings. We operate within three lines of operation: The ALS (Amonyx Augmented Lift System) providing 400% increased lift on fixed wings aircraft and 50% reduced drag over the wings during transit. This enables aircraft to either take of at 50% reduced Take Off speed @ 25% runway length or at least double the MTOW at similar take of speed. The technology can be fitted any size fixed wing aircraft from large cargo aircraft over a commercial commuter size aircraft to a small single engine aircraft.  The ART (Amonyx Rotor Technology) providing 300% increased lift and 50% reduced noise emission and thereby enhanced endurance capabilities. This also provides enhanced capabilities in thin atmosphere operations. Furthermore, a dramatic reduction of noise emissions from the rotor blades enables tolerable operations perfectly fitting the future Urban Air Mobility applications. The AM-X fixed wing UAV series providing unprecedented capabilities within payload and range, and even combining the ALS and ART in to one system. THE AM-X UAV can be tailored to fit ISR task in the security domain (MALE – 250kg payload – 48hrs endurance) as well as being the enabler of unmanned high payload air transport for the cargo sector having the ability to take off and land at very short air strips <50m long carrying +1000kg.

All'epoca – siamo negli anni 50 – la vita del volovelista è resa difficile dalla convivenza con i velivoli a motore che, per esigenze di traffico aereo, limitano di fatto l'attività in quota degli alianti. Si comincia pertanto a pensare alla creazione di un campo dedicato esclusivamente al volo a vela, logisticamente vicino alle montagne e lontano dagli spazi aerei controllati: un sogno apparentemente irrealizzabile ma, come talvolta accade, destinato a diventare realtà. Viene così identificata un’area sulla sponda Nord del lago di Varese costituita da campi poco coltivati e molto umidi. Nel 1961 viene così inaugurato, grazie anche all'aiuto del papà di Adele, l'imprenditore Silvio Mazzucchelli, l'aeroclub che sarebbe stato più tardi intitolato ad Adele e Giorgio Orsi. Oggi, a sessant'anni di distanza, ACAO rappresenta un'eccellenza che da lustro ad un territorio, quello del varesotto, storicamente definito come “la provincia con le ali” grazie alla più forte concentrazione di industria aeronautica del Paese fin dai tempi del primo Novecento.",Italy,1.994965,,,

Una de nuestras principales virtudes es que todas nuestras máquinas son portátiles, siendo capaces de atender a nuestros clientes en sus propias instalaciones, con lo que se evitan costes de traslado de moldes/utillajes y se reducen los tiempos de máquina parada.  La soldadura láser, aporta la distinción de que no se producen distorsiones térmicas ni mecánicas en los materiales procesados, no se varía la dureza, se puede soldar cualquier tipo de metal (Cu, Cu-Be, Aluminio, Titanio, Acero, Plata, etc…) además de que al tratarse de una soldadura más precisa se reducen las tareas posteriores de ajuste. Todo ello hace de la soldadura láser el método idóneo para reparaciones y/o modificaciones de molde y utillajes y eliminación de grabados. Todo ello partiendo del asesoramiento técnico y la profesionalidad de técnicos cualificados y con amplia experiencia en el sector. El grabado-marcado láser  nos permite insertar cualquier referencia, logotipo, fechador, etc… en los moldes o el utillaje de una determinada empresa, a partir de un diseño entregado por el propio cliente o a partir de diseños creados por nosotros mismos.  En cuanto a la limpieza láser, se trata de un proceso en el que se vaporiza la suciedad, no existiendo contacto físico con el material a limpiar, y con el que se evita el uso de productos químicos, la generación de residuos, y el empleo de medios mecánicos de limpieza que implican la aparición de marcas y con el tiempo variaciones dimensionales.

It has a very unique inter/multi-national perspective with its roots in Europe, but with an active American, Eastern, and Asian engagement. We started life as a study = a capability reality check, that evolved into a technical solution for sub-orbital spaceflight that then acquired a consortium of companies, agencies, and individuals: who all made valuable contributions to critique and shore-up this multi-faceted endeavour. We have realised after many years of investment that our niche area of expertise encompasses the Edge of Space. This is anything from 10km to 150km altitude, from 10 m/s to Mach 5, from robotic to piloted flight, from philantropic to business practical.  Our strengths are technical and regulatory. This is where we excel. But we are pragmatic and self-aware to realise that business excellence is much more multidisciplinary. Our world requires applied expertise across a range of disciplines to execute to solve a problem. No single person or small group is able to be good at everything. We therefore have assembled a functioning, diverse, and resourceful team built of all the niche things needed for Edge of Space. We have an entrepreneurial mind-set and a business approach that has been honed through interactions with some very good entrepreneurial business schools and people. This has given a good understanding of the emerging NewSpace markets and their caveats. Core Specialities: Space-aeroplane Type Design and ICAO Annex 8 compatible certification and operations.

Although in recent years the aviation sector has put significant efforts in stabilising its CO2 emissions at 2020 levels through a combination of technological innovations and regulation, a lot remains to be done to reduce the overall impact of aviation on climate.  ClimOp aims to investigate, in a sound research framework, which operational improvements may have a positive impact on climate, taking non-CO2 effects from NOx, water vapour and contrails, into account.  As a first step, ClimOP will identify a set of operational improvements that are potentially effective in reducing the impact of aviation on climate. A preliminary list of promising improvements includes, for example, electric taxiing, flexible runway usage and intelligent runways lights, flexible terminal-manoeuvring-area operations and intermediate stops. ClimOp will quantify the impact these measures have on climate.  Subsequently, the feasibility, effectiveness, and impact on aviation stakeholders of the proposed operational improvements will be validated with representatives of all actors in the aviation industry, such as airlines, airports, passengers and ANSPs. The validation will also account for economic factors and the constraints posed by safety and security requirements.  Finally, harmonised mitigation strategies will be provided, together with a series of recommendations for policymakers, to support measures to implement the proposed set of operational improvements.",Belgium,1.05746,,,

Die EUROAVIA ist eine Kooperation von Affiliated Societies (angegliederten Gesellschaften), die aus voneinander unabhängig agierenden, studentischen Gruppen an verschiedenen Universitäten Europas besteht. Während des ganzen Jahres organisieren die lokalen Gruppen zahlreiche nationale und internationale Events für ihre Mitglieder. Diese decken eine große Vielfalt von spannenden Themen ab. Sie reichen von technischen Projekten über generelle Versammlungen bis hin zu kulturellen Zusammentreffen. Unsere größten Ziele sind gemeinsame Erfahrungen zu sammeln und das persönliche Wachsen des Einzelnen zu fördern. Für uns ist es wichtig die Verbindung zwischen Studium und Jobleben herzustellen. Unsere unpolitische, gemeinnützige Studenteninitiative wird nur von Studenten geleitet. Die Mitglieder bringen ihre ganz individuellen Möglichkeiten, eigenes Wissen und ihre Kultur ein und wachsen dabei oft über sich hinaus. Der Kopf der Organisation auf internationaler Ebene ist das International Board. Es koordiniert die Aktivitäten der einzelnen Working Groups und Affiliated Societies. Mitglied bei uns zu sein ist mehr als nur Arbeiten oder internationale Kontakte aufbauen. Es ist mehr als nur Erfahrung sammeln.

Our mission is to provide a noiseless and emission-free powertrain as a sustainable solution to noise and emission related acceptance problems through technological innovation and thus becoming an enabler for the new air mobility for intermodal transport.  The core innovation of our propulsion system is an ultra-silent ducted propeller - the jetpeller - with a proprietary architecture and blade design that largely cuts noise generation and propagation, in combination with a modular, hybrid-electric powertrain platform. Therefore, we are investigating both multi-fuel piston engines with electric boost and also hydrogen fuel cell concepts for a green propulsion. This also includes energy storage aspects.  Besides supplying the complete powertrain and single components, we support as JETPEL our customers with powerplant integration from energy storage to cooling, engineering and simulations, access to a highly modern test infrastructure and provides consulting in certification.",Germany,1.043062,,,

To obtain the ACC3 status, an air carrier needs to submit its relevant air cargo or mail security operations in non-EU countries to an EU aviation security independent validation. This exercise, is carried out by an EU aviation security independent validator. The validator assess the carrier's security program to ensure its relevance and completeness.   In addition, our EU Aviation Security Independent Validators, will assess ACC3 implementation of aviation security measures during an on-site verification. The EU independent security validator will draft a report based on his findings and provide it the appropriate authority of the EU Member State that has been assigned for the designation of the ACC3. This validation needs to be reissued every five years according to the EU Regulation. If the ACC3 validated carrier wishes to have the security controls applied by a business partner such as known consignors, regulated agents or ground handlers at non-EU airports, these entities will also have to undergo independent validation, either as part of the carrier's accreditation or in their own right. Hawk Aviation Consultancy Independent Validators can assist you on this accreditation aswell.  Examples of aviation security training that we can provide:  *Aviation Security Training for security staff working on a security filter (passenger, crew and/or staff check) *Air Cargo Security training, all levels.  *Inflight supplies security training, all levels Examples of aviation security consultancy that we can provide: *ACC3/RA3/KC3 validations or pre-validations *EU Aviation/Air Cargo Security Consultancy/advisory *EU Aviation/Air Cargo Security Auditing Interested in one of our many services?.

Door2Door B.V.,629334.0,"Netherlands, North Holland, Amsterdam, 26 Kribbestraat",https://www.linkedin.com/company/door2door-bv,fromdoortodoor.nl,"Ticket prices are distorted to stay competitive. As a result, ticket prices become less transparent, and the consumer is misled into buying the “cheapest” ticket. Additional costs, such as service costs, administration fees or fees for luggage and seat assignment are often not displayed when looking for a plane ticket. Even if all these costs were considered the consumer still has an incomplete view of their trip ahead. Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) often fly from B-location airports to B-location airports, making the first and last mile of the trip more time consuming and more expensive. As of today, no good option to compare transportation from door-to-door exists. Our mission is to make travel easier with a door-to-door travel solution that calculates the optimal journey based on price, both for the flight and all other transportation to and from airports, and travel time. We do so by offering a platform where the traveler can leverage user profiles, group travel options, a real-time itinerary, offline travel guides, and a one-stop-shop to book all transportation and additional services in one place. We want to make life easier, take away the hassle and make people happy. Travelling should be fun and relaxing, people should not fight over their itinerary, argue whether the bus is faster, or why they have been walking for ten blocks and still have not found their destination.

Its speed and range made it the ideal bomber escort. Our Mustang was built in 1944. It served with the 434th Fighter Squadron, 479th Fighter Group as “SCAT VII” L2-W. It was the personal plane of Major Robin Olds, a triple ace who scored his 4 last kills in this particular machine. It is one of those rare P-51 Mustangs who survived WWII and is now still flying in the same color scheme it had over 70 years ago. Experience the Mustang P-51 yourself with our special Hero-package for €2.200 all-in, contact us for a personalised offer.  Great news: We have recently established a partnership with the Antwerp-based Stampe & Vertongen museum to support them and keep its vintage aircraft in the air. One of these iconic aircraft is the ex-Belgian Air Force Fouga Magister CM.170 ""MT-5"". The twin-engine jet trainer joined the Belgian Air Force in 1960 and was once part of the famous display team 'Red Devils', of which it is now the only one retaining its original color scheme. After retirement from the Air Force, ""MT-5"" was shipped to Israel and later flew in the USA for a private owner. In 2014, ""MT-5"" arrived back at its new home base in Antwerp. The aircraft received major restoration and could finally return to the Belgian skies in 2017, where it belongs. In order to keep the Fouga in the air, you can sponsor the Fouga Project by donating €2.000 or more to the S&V museum. In return for your generous gift, one of our Fouga pilots will give you a unique hands-on experience.

It’s located on the “La Collina” airfield, close to the village of Borgo San Lorenzo, north of the city of  Firenze. The 750x50m grass runway is served by a 600 sq.m. hangar which houses the club’s fleet and some privately owned gliders. Many more are located outside in their trailers during the best part of the gliding season, usually March to October. A small club house with toilets and showers completes the setup. There also is a certified aeronautical repair shop resident on the same field. The airfield is beautifully set in the quiet location of this northern corner of Tuscany, the Mugello valley, between the northern hills of Firenze and the Appennini mountains. Our gliding school has started in 1995, and an average of 7 new pilots per year take their licence following its courses. The current number of club members is about 70, and the club’s fleet is composed by four two-seaters and two towplanes. Additionally, about 20 private gliders are resident on the airfield. The field is an excellent starting point for cross-country flights along the spine of Italy, the Appennini range. Flights exceeding 500km are not uncommon at all, with the longest recorded well above 800 km. Several of our pilots are keen competitors, making the top rankings in national and international gliding competitions.

In Sardegna il liquore forse più antico è il Filu ‘e ferru… sempre un filo, dunque, uno SPAGO. I nostri criteri ispiratori: GENUINITÀ dei prodotti, intesa come purezza dei prodotti utilizzati. NATURALEZZA degli ingredienti utilizzati: solo prodotti di prima qualità, selezionati all’origine. ARTIGIANALITÀ della lavorazione: ogni singolo prodotto nasce dalle sperimentazioni effettuate dal suo ideatore, e la produzione avviene senza alcun carattere di industrialità. FANTASIA nel mixare le decine di ingredienti che la natura offre, al fine di fornire prodotti sempre nuovi, e tali da incuriosire e sollecitare il gusto dei clienti.",Italy,0.578264,,,

Multiple communities are now interested in NEOs for very different reasons ranging from science to planetary defence and commercial objectives (e.g., mining, resource extraction & exploitation). Given the shared scientific and technological basis, all of these communities require knowledge and modelling capabilities of asteroid properties, as well as the capability to perform close proximity operations and make relevant measurements. The multi-disciplinary approach at the heart of NEO-MAPP is perfectly suited for providing the significant improvements required in each of these aspects. Building on the expertise of NEO-MAPP participants, who have been and are currently involved in small-body space missions as well as EC-funded NEO-related projects, the NEO-MAPP consortium is ideally set to further advance NEO scientific research and payload technologies. NEO-MAPP will not only address two of the three sub-topics indicated in the present call but will also dedicate considerable resources to developing important and innovative synergies between the two sub-topics. As such, NEO-MAPP will provide significant advances in our understanding of NEOs while at the same time build upon and sustainably increase expertise of European scientists and engineers in both planetary defence efforts and small-body exploration. The main goal of NEO-MAPP is to provide significant advances in both our understanding of the response of NEOs to external forces (in particular a kinetic impact or a close planetary approach), and in the associated measurements by a spacecraft (including those necessary for the physical and dynamical characterization in general).",Luxembourg,0.521531,,,

Furthermore, Qualiteit Consultancy enables organizations to establish a continuous improvement process in favor of safety, productivity, absenteeism and employee satisfaction, by implementing a data- driven Fatigue Risk Management System.

Acknowledgment in European legislation: The need for a Fatigue Risk Management System is increasingly recognized within Europe and is already partially included in the Aviation Industry as a mandatory element in European legislation (EASA Flight Time Limitations, FTL). Based on 15 years of experience Qualiteit Consultancy can offer you the following products and/ or services: - ad interim project management  - complete implementation of a Fatigue Risk Management System, from  gap-analysis to approval - the development of Fatigue Risk Management training for both initial as recurrent training purposes - providing training concerning Fatigue Risk Management and Work and Rest rules, applicable for all   stakeholders involved  - documentation assurance - advice and support on the selection and implementation of Fatigue Risk Management software  - the implementation of prescriptive rules concerning work and rest requirements, including an impact   analysis, advice and an implementation plan - relation management with Authorities and other stakeholders involved",Netherlands,0.187199,,,
