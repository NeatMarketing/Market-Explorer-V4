CO2, a desirable digital currency and account. Free riding occurs when those who benefit from certain goods or services do not pay for them, leading to scarcity and shortage for all. When it comes to fighting climate change, and the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, we run up against this classical economic problem of free riding. We all benefit from stable atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but rarely pay for this stability when emitting CO2 (e.g. from heating, transport). We are fast running out of time to find and stimulate the voluntary measures that will enable us to meet the Paris Agreement target. Can we incentivize voluntary actions to change free rider behavior ? Individual and company open a CO2 account, reduce CO2 emissions and are credited 1.000 CO2s per tonne of CO2 abated. For example, if an individual replaces a combustion engine vehicle with an electrical vehicle, this reduces CO2 emissions by about 2 tonnes (following United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change accounting rules). His CO2 account is then credited with 2.000 CO2s annually, for 10 years. The CO2 account is a credit account, holding units of CO2. Voluntary actors are empowered to ‘mine’ (generate) CO2s to credit their account.  The CO2 account is operated through a mobile app. CO2s may then be sent through social networks within the community, or spent everywhere using the CO2 payment card which converts CO2s into $ automatically. Credit may also be added to the account by purchasing CO2s. This unique value proposition, together with our pricing policy to remove hidden banking fees, makes the CO2 account competitive in the banking industry, and a typical fintech new service.  The more agents use their CO2 account in complement to their bank account, the more traction is created on CO2s. This allows a global community of voluntary actors to fight climate change simply, and daily, resulting in a systemic change.",France,2.474204,,,

Imagine how technology could track data to help businesses make decisions for food systems to become truly sustainable. You might say: Isn’t sustainable food just a trend for the wealthy?” Right now many certifications are expensive, complicated and not accessible to SMEs (90% of all organization) to engage massive climate action. ClearKarma is changing that! The ClearKarma movement is committed to reverse damages caused by food production through tracing its global impact and soon fundraising to invest in solutions to protect people and planet. Research shows we should in reality multiply the retail price by 2 to cover the hidden costs of food, reaching 12 trillion USD globally! Right now nobody covers the cost of biodiversity loss, soil or water pollution, health or social costs. Time to act is now! Even if we wanted to, where can we pay the true cost of food? The longer we wait and do nothing, the higher the food price for us and future generations! Therefor ClearKarma empowers small and mid-sized organizations to easily track back each impact to its root cause and standardize/certify their carbon footprint or broader impact. Benefits range from funding via carbon credits, tax cuts or credits to fund more sustainable process management and sourcing.
