This could have been a sleepy French country hotel like so many others. However, jazz pianist Jacques Loussier, the man who invented playback, had other ideas. At the nearby Chateau Miraval, lately owned by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, he decided to create a recording studio, which would go on to host the likes of Pink Floyd, Wham!, The Cure, French crooner Joe Dassin, and Shirley Bassey. Due to the proximity to Miraval mainly of the peoples and musicians stayed at Lou Calen and start a close friendship with  the Caren family. During the 70s and 80s, Huguette’s cooking was recognised as some of the best in the Var, Provence Verte. Being on the cover of the Gault Millau Magazine helped build the reputation and the success of Lou Calen, but above all it was the convivial atmosphere coupled with the excellent cooking, which cemented its place in local folklore.  For more than 20 years, the hotel has stood empty. Expecting the building will come-back alive and the walls could talk and regale us with tales of almost three decades of life as a hotel and restaurant. On the day of the re-opening, the Lou Calen (a traditional Provencal oil lamp) will be turned back on and once again becoming a leading beacon for hospitality in Provence.

Committed to the AMAP philosophy (Association for the Preservation of Rural Farming.), the Executive Chef cooks exclusively using goods received from regional producers, and only using organically-grown products.

Chaque destination, chaque hôtel dévoile ses surprises. Sauna sur le toit, brasserie, bar à cocktails…le champ des possibles est ouvert. Pour Anouk et Louis, tous les esprits créatifs sont les bienvenus.  Autour d’eux, 100 talents. 100 personnalités avec leurs qualités, leurs défauts. Tous fiers de faire vivre la vie des hôtels Orso.  Et un fil conducteur toujours à l’esprit : faire repartir les clients avec le sourire. Chez Orso, tout ce qui est bon est un crédo. La bonne idée, le bon geste au bon moment, la bonne surprise, le bon plan à donner, la bonne limonade à l’arrivée, le bon sourire du matin, le bonsoir du soir… Anouk et Louis croient à la générosité dans la simplicité.

En 2005, Imaad Rahmouni lui apporte l'esprit des matières de la Méditerranée de rêve où le rouge rime avec Murano, où les lumières, les couleurs et les matières se conjuguent pour créer des atmosphères feutrées, délicates et vibrantes. Derrière sa façade discrète, les espaces de vie s'articulent autour d'un patio ouvert sur le ciel dans lequel un jardin s'élève verticalement sur plus de 30 mètres. Ce jardin comprend plus de 300 espèces d'arbres, d'arbustes, de plantes venant des Philippines, de l'Himalaya, d'Amazonie... On doit cette prouesse à Patrick Blanc, le célèbre botaniste, l'auteur par ailleurs du Mur végétal qui habille l'une des façades du Musée du Quai Branly à Paris.

Nous travaillons ensemble le positionnement de chaque hôtel, parce que je suis convaincu qu’aucun hôtel ne devrait être commercialisé comme son voisin.

En 2015, deux événements vont marquer les prémices de cette nouvelle aventure hôtelière. Au Canada, à l’occasion de l’implantation de son premier Village sur le terrain de l’Hôtel Horizon, un bâtiment historique au cœur de la station de ski de Sutton, Huttopia rénove entièrement l’hôtel, son café et son restaurant dans un esprit de convivialité, de mixité et d’intégration au territoire.

En effet, la partie qui jouxte l’église était un ancien couvent. Une situation privilégiée à 2 heures de Paris entre Orléans et Tours  L’hôtel Relais des Trois Châteaux est situé à 800m du Château de Cheverny. C’est une étape incontournable des Châteaux de la Loire. Son château du 17 e siècle, un des rares châteaux de la Loire à être si richement meublé, décoré… et encore habité par un Marquis. Les lecteurs de Tintin y reconnaitront peut-être le château du capitaine Haddock, Moulinsart ! Aujourd’hui cet établissement s’inscrit dans une dynamique pour la préservation de l’histoire et de l’esprit de rencontre qui règne depuis toujours dans ce lieu de cœur de village Cour-Cheverny, véritable poumon relationnel pour les clients fidèles. Le Relais des trois châteaux est un hôtel de charme 4 étoiles dont l’ambiance évoque le style Renaissance. Les meubles ont été dessinés tout en rondeur, les luminaires de fabrication artisanale et les tentures aux tonalités chaleureuses respectent le style raffiné et la douceur du Val de Loire. Le Relais des Trois Châteaux a obtenu le label « Qualité Tourisme » délivré par le Ministère du Tourisme. Il vous garantit sur la durée des engagements pris par les professionnels du tourisme dans les domaines suivants : la communication et l’information, le savoir-faire et le savoir-être, le confort et la propreté des lieux, le développement durable, la valorisation touristique du territoire et la qualité de la prestation.",France,2.339228,,,

The only evidence of the old building is the framework of the 18th century house which houses the bar and a duplex room. The rest is new. We relied on simple and durable materials, without artifice: concrete, wood, stone or glass. Some of the more technological materials, such as the shell of the 16 Hi-Macs® rooms, blend into a whole that will develop a patina over time, with a constant concern for the impeccable presentation of both private and communal areas. The hotel is also the bar. Parisians meet there alongside the hotel's guests, sheltered from the hustle and bustle of the city. Invisible from the street, nestled in the heart of the hotel, it reveals its jewel, a courtyard immersed in a vertical garden that has taken possession of the surrounding walls. It is an intimate, comfortable, open but secret haven, sheltered from the hubbub. The bar team shares its passion with guests in search of new discoveries. Mixology enthusiasts can choose from one of the 15 cocktails on the menu or indulge in a creation according to their taste and desire... In the cool of the summer or by the outdoor fireplace in winter... Welcoming guests with attention, relaxation, kindness, politeness and simplicity... The team has built up this state of mind, our primary objective. In the end, the real challenge is not to open a hotel, but to ensure that it keeps its promise over time. This is what we strive to do every day with the understanding that serving is an honour.",France,2.339228,,,

Son nouveau décor et celui de ses 30 chambres s’inspirent largement de cet environnement privilégié : on y évolue au milieu des livres, comme autant de clins d’œil au Paris littéraire de Saint-Germain-des-Prés et à l’université voisine de la Sorbonne, mais aussi des lithographies et souvenirs de voyages empreints de poésie, mettant à l’honneur la faune et la flore du Jardin des Plantes tout proche. As the former home of a family who once played a significant part in the artistic community of the Left Bank, the HOTEL MONGE, in the heart of the 5th arrondissement of Paris, has always been an address of prestige and significance in the Latin Quarter.This charming 4-star hotel reopened in 2016 following a complete renovation. The new décor of the establishment and its 30 bedrooms is largely inspired by the district in which it stands; a district that evolved in close harmony with the world of books. So, naturally, the design of the décor offers numerous nods to the literary Paris of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and the neighbouring University of Paris, known as the Sorbonne, as well as lithographs and souvenirs of journeys emblazoned with poetry and honouring the flora and fauna of the nearby Jardin des Plantes.",France,1.888002,,,

À quelques pas des plages, l’hôtel Le Sud propose une expérience hôtelière inédite dans la région, une adresse intime et chaleureuse où séjourner le temps d’une escapade sur la French Riviera. L’hôtel trois étoiles qui dispose de 29 chambres, d’un bar et d’une grande terrasse ouverte à tous est un projet familial imaginé par des natifs de la région, le propriétaire Julien Lizée et l’architecte d’intérieur Stéphanie Lizée. Celle-ci a revisité les codes stylistiques du Sud avec subtilité, ainsi les murs talochés, le grès, la terre cuite, la rayure, le rotin, dialoguent avec des objets chinés dans les alentours et du mobilier dessiné sur mesure, réalisés le plus souvent par des artisans locaux. L’esprit du Sud est ici habilement maîtrisé, à la fois revisité et modernisé, sans ostentation ni caricature. La richesse culturelle et artistique de la région a été une grande source d’inspiration, tant pour le choix de la palette de couleurs que pour le graphisme et la décoration. L’âme de Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Jean Cocteau ou des céramistes de Vallauris planent sur les lieux, tel un hommage à cette Côte d’Azur rayonnante qui a tant inspiré les artistes au milieu du XXe siècle. Cette empreinte artistique a également été un fil conducteur pour l’artiste Franck Lebraly qui a imaginé le logo de l’hôtel, les fresques et les interventions picturales dans les chambres, le bar et les escaliers.",France,1.754421,,,

L’univers du Seakub s’inspire de l’architecture des années 50 à Royan : simple et créative, fonctionnelle et audacieuse, jouant avec la lumière, les couleurs et les lignes, célébrant la joie de vivre particulière à ses années d’après guerre. Edifié à cette période, le petit immeuble où se niche aujourd’hui le Seakub était à l’origine une pension de famille, toute simple, populaire. Les chambres n’étaient pas immenses, les salles d’eau encore moins, mais les larges ouvertures, les loggias, l’accès direct à la plage permettaient à tous de profiter des premiers congés payés en bord de mer. La rénovation complète de l’hôtel, réalisée en 2023, préserve soigneusement les volumes et l’architecture de l’époque. Elle y ajoute bien sûr le confort attendu aujourd’hui : climatisation, insonorisation, literie haut de gamme, choix de matériaux de qualité… Elle y développe aussi, grâce aux artisans, artistes, illustrateurs et graphistes mobilisés sur ce projet, un esthétisme inspiré des années 50, mais résolument actuel. Que vous veniez à Royan pour un séjour d’affaires, un week-end ou pour vos vacances, vous y serez comme chez vous. Après la plage, ou entre deux rendez-vous d’affaires, détendez-vous dans le jardin, bouquinez ou écoutez de la musique dans le salon… les espaces communs du Seakub sont à votre disposition toute la journée. Garantie d’un séjour calme et attentionné, le Seakub n’a que 8 chambres. Sur la mer ou sur le jardin abrité d’un majestueux Mimosa, à vous de choisir ! Situé au centre de Royan, sur la plage de la grande Conche, le Seakub est proche de tous les sites incontournables de la cité balnéaire : le marché central, l’église, le palais des congrès, les plages… Commerces et restaurants sont facilement accessibles à pied. Et grâce au large réseau de pistes cyclables, se sont aussi tous les paysages ouverts et lumineux de la Côte de Beauté qui s’ouvrent à vos balades en vélo",France,1.280276,,,

This process is digitalized by our platform, taking into account factors such as: timing optimization, accuracy of  research and administrative follow up.  Dislodge today, Receive tomorrow.  Beside traditional reservation websites, thanks to LodginGO you can also receive customers from other hotels having to dislodge them and increase your occupancy rate.   The efficiency of LodginGO is the fruit of a program that answers in the interest of:  - The hotel that dislodge its customer  - The hotel that receive the customer   - And the customers themselves.",France,1.169614,,,

The hotel's interior decor was designed by Jacques Garcia, whose unique style is immediately recognizable. Shapes, colors, and motifs from different eras come together in a harmonious polyphony. From Orientalist and Neo-Gothic to French Classicism, Baroque and Empire styles, each detail takes you on a journey through time. Mixed in with the decor, aficionados will recognize certain exquisite French antiques: a Viollet-le-Duc chandelier, an Aubusson tapestry, and a collection of 19th century engravings... Jacques Garcia, an avid collector, arranged these works of art in the different rooms, in tribute to the time periods that inspired him. In a bold move, Bourg Tibourg has added seven rooms with a style that is radically different from that of Jacques Garcia. With white tones, precious wood and sleek lines, the junior suites designed by Chartier Dalix offer our guests a new experience. Bright daylight flows through the large bay windows overlooking the garden, softening the adjustable lighting specially designed for the hotel. Thanks to this powerful decorative contrast, the Bourg Tibourg offers its guests two distinct types of beauty, and two concepts of luxury and tranquility, which do not counteract one another, but rather engage in a creative dialogue.

Nous pouvons tout d'abord apporter une aide pour établir un plan d'actions marketing : le yield management, l'analyse de la distribution, le pricing dynamique, veille concurentielle, positionnement du produit.
