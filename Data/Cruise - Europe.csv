Graduado en 1964, inició su trayectoria con el diseño de grandes buques para el histórico astillero La Naval de Sestao (Bizkaia), para posteriormente fundar su propia empresa de construcción de embarcaciones de recreo, Yates Revilo, que a lo largo de casi una década llevó a cabo cerca de una treintena de proyectos. En 1978 creó su propia oficina técnica, desde la que continuó desarrollando proyectos innovadores para armadores y astilleros de todo el mundo. A partir de 1990 puso en marcha la nueva firma OLIVER DESIGN, con el objetivo de potenciar su proyección internacional. En pocos años la empresa multiplicó y diversifico su actividad para abarcar no sólo el proyecto, sino la habilitación de interiores e incluso superestructuras completas, buscando proporcionar un servicio integral a sus clientes. Iñigo Oliver, Director General se incorporó a la empresa en el año 1987 y su hijo Iñi Oliver lleva trabajando en Oliver Design desde el año 2015 después de graduarse con honores como Arquitecto Naval en la Universidad de Southampton OLIVER DESIGN está en disposición de asumir todas las tareas previas a la puesta en servicio de buques de cualquier tipo. Su catálogo de servicios incluye labores especializadas en diferentes áreas desde el diseño conceptual hasta la supervisión de obra pasando por todo el desarrollo del proyecto arquitéctónico y diseño de interiores. El principal valor añadido de OLIVER DESIGN es la creación de proyectos singulares con un alto grado de innovación y diseño contando con un catálogo de proyectos con más de 400 barcos de la más variada tipología a lo largo de 25 años: desde buques escuela a yates de recreo y de turismo, pasando por barcos de transporte, pesqueros, dragas, ferris, cruceros, etc. La trayectoria de la empresa está avalada por múltiples reconocimientos y galardones internacionales, entre ellos varios Premios Shippax de diseño naval. OLIVER DESIGN ocupa un emplazamiento singular. Alejada de polígonos industriales y de oficinas en el centro de la ciudad, la empresa proyectó y construyó una sede integrada en su entorno natural. Se ubica en Getxo (Bizkaia), a muy poca distancia de los acantilados de la Galea, una atalaya sobre el Golfo de Bizkaia que da acceso al Puerto de Bilbao, el más importante del Norte de España desde su fundación en el siglo XIII. La compañía cuenta también con delegaciones en Santander y Cádiz.","9383750","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart Sail utilizza il rating quale migliore stima delle prestazioni di ogni barca LA PROSPETTIVA: Smart Sail propone tecnologie innovative per la vela e combina previsioni meteo personalizzate con le rotte. Un mondo che coinvolge tutti gli amanti del mare, siano essi semplici amanti delle barche a vela per crociere in sicurezza o fanatici delle competizioni e delle regate. LA SOLUZIONE: Smart sail propone due nuove applicazioni per gli amanti della vela: “smart regatta” che consente la previsione in tempo reale delle prestazioni specifiche di ogni barca da regata.

The port itself is made up of the port of Vlissingen, located on the northern shore of the estuary, and the port of Terneuzen on the southern side. Due to its strategic position, this port is one of the most ideally situated harbors in northwestern Europe. A wide variety of full and half-day shore excursions starting from the port where cruise ships are accommodated are possible. All locations are within an hour’s drive of the port. Discover Zeeland  Zeeland, a province of the Netherlands, is situated on the North Sea coast in the far southwest of the country. Two mighty estuaries transect it: the Eastern Scheldt (in Dutch Oosterschelde) and the Western Scheldt (in Dutch Westerschelde). The province is made up of water, islands and peninsulas. Zeeland’s open, panoramic scenery is impressive. The countryside is made up largely of farmland and wetlands. Small towns and villages, many of them historic and scattered across the countryside, form the characteristic landscape.  Sparkling Cities Vlissingen is situated on the mouth of the Western Scheldt estuary and is famous for its seaside boulevards in the southern district. From here, you can see and, almost, touch the ships passing by on their way to and from the ports of Vlissingen, Ghent and Antwerp; ranging from the smallest seagoing vessels through the largest container carriers. The town has a rich history of fishery, (slave) trading, shipbuilding and piracy, as you can see on a visit to one of its museums or Het Arsenaal theme park. Throughout its history Vlissingen has been besieged many times by armies and floods, both of which destroyed some of its historic buildings and squares. Those that survived have been – and still are – restored with great love and skill.","","","","","","","","","","",""
