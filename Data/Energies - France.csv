Ces constats ont conduit en 2007 à la création du RAPPEL, un réseau ouvert et informel : l’adhésion relève d’une simple inscription et aucun des métiers concernés n’est mis en avant ou ostracisé. Les objectifs du réseau RAPPEL sont de : -	Mettre en relation et aider les structures qui cherchent apporter des solutions préventives et curatives durables la précarité énergétique. -	Capitaliser, mutualiser et donner à voir les diverses expériences menées dans les territoires : animation de fonds sociaux d’aide aux travaux de maîtrise de l’énergie, SLIME, déploiement de programmes locaux et nationaux d’amélioration énergétique des logements des personnes défavorisées, opérations de sensibilisation ou de formation. -	Promouvoir la prise en compte de la précarité énergétique dans les politiques publiques en dialoguant de manière régulière avec les institutionnels compétents sur les divers champs couverts par le problème de la précarité énergétique. -	Réfléchir sur des pistes d’actions, la reproductibilité d’actions existantes, la création ou l’utilisation d’outils déjà existants à mettre à disposition des membres. Aujourd'hui, le réseau RAPPEL rassemble plus de 1000 membres de cultures professionnelles et d’horizons divers (action sociale, maitrise de l’énergie, amélioration de l’habitat, santé…) dans 96 départements.
