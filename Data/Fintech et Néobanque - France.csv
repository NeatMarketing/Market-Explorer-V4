CO2, a desirable digital currency and account. Free riding occurs when those who benefit from certain goods or services do not pay for them, leading to scarcity and shortage for all. When it comes to fighting climate change, and the need to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, we run up against this classical economic problem of free riding. We all benefit from stable atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but rarely pay for this stability when emitting CO2 (e.g. from heating, transport). We are fast running out of time to find and stimulate the voluntary measures that will enable us to meet the Paris Agreement target. Can we incentivize voluntary actions to change free rider behavior ? Individual and company open a CO2 account, reduce CO2 emissions and are credited 1.000 CO2s per tonne of CO2 abated. For example, if an individual replaces a combustion engine vehicle with an electrical vehicle, this reduces CO2 emissions by about 2 tonnes (following United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change accounting rules). His CO2 account is then credited with 2.000 CO2s annually, for 10 years. The CO2 account is a credit account, holding units of CO2. Voluntary actors are empowered to ‘mine’ (generate) CO2s to credit their account.  The CO2 account is operated through a mobile app. CO2s may then be sent through social networks within the community, or spent everywhere using the CO2 payment card which converts CO2s into $ automatically. Credit may also be added to the account by purchasing CO2s. This unique value proposition, together with our pricing policy to remove hidden banking fees, makes the CO2 account competitive in the banking industry, and a typical fintech new service.  The more agents use their CO2 account in complement to their bank account, the more traction is created on CO2s. This allows a global community of voluntary actors to fight climate change simply, and daily, resulting in a systemic change.","2474204","","","","","","","","","",""

La Coop regroupe associés, salariés et quelques coop'ains indépendants, combinant des compétences paiement et des personnalités complémentaires.

La Coop présente une assise financière solide (nous sommes fiers de notre note G3 à la Banque de France) mais ne se fixe aucun objectif de croissance ou de bénéfices. La Coop a fait le choix de ne pas avoir de bureau mais encourage les échanges en ligne ou au café du coin… La Coop n’oublie pas son engagement social et environnemental ; dès 2014, nous avons adhéré au pacte du monde de l’ONU. Et oui, les fourmis font leur part de colibris, notamment à travers le don aux associations caritatives. Même si nous sommes petits, nous avons notre plan d’action RSE ! Enfin, les fourmis n’oublient pas de se faire plaisir à travers diverses initiatives pour animer leur activité : citons notamment les avatars et illustrations d’Elvire, les goodies, LE séminaire annuel de la colonie et autres festivités. La Coop a bien grandi depuis sa création en 2012. Elle regroupe aujourd’hui plus de 45 expert(e)s du paiement et direct(rices)eurs de projet reconnus sur le marché du paiement. Nos clients, grands groupes mais aussi neobanques, fintech & start up, semblent apprécier notre modèle et nous font confiance parce que la Coop se soucie vraiment d’eux, respecte ses engagements et porte la volonté de mener leurs projets de paiement à bon port.","18877807","","","","","","","","","",""

NextWise est une fintech qui développe une plateforme centrée sur l’éducation financière et une approche très pédagogique de l’investissement : le Next Challenge with Dauphine - PSL. Lancé en octobre 2021, en partenariat avec la House of Finance de l’Université Paris Dauphine, le Next Challenge est bien plus qu’un simple concours boursier.  Sur le principe du ""Learning by doing"", il s’agit d’un véritable parcours pédagogique qui reproduit la vraie vie d'un investisseur et d'une société de gestion.  D'une durée de 7 mois, le challenge est ponctué d’échanges et de rendez-vous entre les concurrents et les partenaires du challenge. Ces derniers participent à l’animation du jeu en apportant contenus, outils pédagogiques et soutien aux participants. Leurs contenus rythment le parcours des étudiants et ont enrichi leur expérience.  Plusieurs des acteurs clés de l’environnement boursier, l’AMF, Euronext, des associations tel que l'AFG, des médias, ainsi que plusieurs émetteurs de référence de la place française soutiennent cette initiative en y contribuant activement.  Les sociétés cotées partenaires de cet événement agissent ainsi pour intéresser les jeunes générations au financement des entreprises et au rôle clé des actions.

All organizations, including SMEs, will be provided methodologies to reduce and fund CO2 emission savings. Did you know that the food we eat is responsible for over 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions? Imagine a world where every bite you take helps heal the planet and nourish local communities. Imagine how technology could track data to help businesses make decisions for food systems to become truly sustainable. You might say: Isn’t sustainable food just a trend for the wealthy?” Right now many certifications are expensive, complicated and not accessible to SMEs (90% of all organization) to engage massive climate action. ClearKarma is changing that! The ClearKarma movement is committed to reverse damages caused by food production through tracing its global impact and soon fundraising to invest in solutions to protect people and planet. Research shows we should in reality multiply the retail price by 2 to cover the hidden costs of food, reaching 12 trillion USD globally! Right now nobody covers the cost of biodiversity loss, soil or water pollution, health or social costs. Time to act is now! Even if we wanted to, where can we pay the true cost of food? The longer we wait and do nothing, the higher the food price for us and future generations! Therefor ClearKarma empowers small and mid-sized organizations to easily track back each impact to its root cause and standardize/certify their carbon footprint or broader impact. Benefits range from funding via carbon credits, tax cuts or credits to fund more sustainable process management and sourcing. Keywords: #standards #climate action #social impact #fundraising #compliance #carbon credits #true cost #blockchain #traceability #circular economy #zero waste #decarbonization #sustainability #CleanTech #data management #artificial intelligence #AI #GreenTech #FinTech #digital transformation >> Let’s invest to heal the broken food system.

Circulariz est la plateforme numérique française de gestion de la circularisation. Elle permet de numériser et d’automatiser entièrement le processus de circularisation pour gagner du temps, raccourcir les délais de réponses et sécuriser davantage la mission du commissaire aux comptes. Pionnière dans son domaine et en parfait respect avec la NEP 505, la plateforme réalise en moins de 20 minutes ce qu’un auditeur fait en moyenne en 6 heures. Collaborative, la plateforme permet de fluidifier et de sécuriser l’échange d’information entre le CAC et les Tiers, en particulier vis à vis des banques, des assurances ou encore des avocats. La plateforme empêche également les sociétés auditées d’intervenir dans la démarche grâce à un fonctionnement totalement autonome qui permet d’interroger les tiers sans risque que leurs réponses soient altérées. Par ailleurs, la mise en place progressive de l’IA au sein de la plateforme va permettre une lecture et une analyse automatique des pièces jointes déposées par les tiers (extraits de comptes, factures), facilitant encore davantage l’exploitation des résultats par les auditeurs financiers.","","","","","","","","","","",""
