Rabot Energy denkt Energie neu und bietet für Kund*innen einen dynamischen Stromtarif für Haushalt und Elektroauto mit 100% Ökostrom an. Das heißt, im Gegensatz zu anderen Stromanbietern, kauft Rabot Energy Strom kurzfristig über den Day-Ahead und Intraday-Markt ein, nutzt somit die stündlichen Preisschwankungen an der Strombörse und gibt den Einkaufspreis direkt an Kund*innen weiter. So können zum Beispiel E-Autos automatisiert dann geladen werden, wenn der Börsenstrompreis in einem festgelegten Ladezeitfenster besonders gering ist. Da bei viel Wind und Sonne die Preise niedrig sind, wird so nicht nur der Geldbeutel geschont, sondern auch die Umwelt.  Den Energieverbrauch sowie das smarte und automatisierte Energiemanagement können Verbraucher*innen in Echtzeit in der Rabot Energy App nachverfolgen und steuern. Ziel ist es, intelligenten und nachhaltigen Stromkonsum für jeden zugänglich zu machen und den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien voranzutreiben, um den Klimawandel zu bekämpfen.","187713359","Company Hiring Event.

In poco tempo cresciamo e diventiamo il principale fornitore di energia elettrica, gas e sistemi di efficientamento energetico delle Province di La Spezia e Massa-Carrara. La presenza sul territorio e la vicinanza alle persone che lo abitano sono da sempre i nostri punti di forza; per questo negli anni la nostra rete è cresciuta in modo capillare e oggi ci trovi nei comuni di La Spezia, Sarzana, Levanto, Ceparana, Aulla, Pontremoli, Marina di Carrara, Carrara, Deiva Marina e Brugnato. Il nostro tratto distintivo è il rapporto diretto e trasparente con la clientela, famiglie, imprese e condomini che scelgono di rivolgersi a noi; una relazione basata sulla fiducia, la competenza e la cortesia dei dipendenti, gli operatori di sportello e i consulenti della rete commerciale. Attenzione al Cliente e ascolto dei suoi bisogni, personalizzazione del servizio offerto, attaccamento al territorio, costruzione di sinergie e partnership con le realtà locali: sono i punti fermi che ci guidano e che ci spingono a tenere alta la fiducia di chi sceglie Spigas Clienti come proprio partner e fornitore. Crescere in modo sostenibile con la crescita del territorio: è questo, secondo noi, il primo passo per diventare il fornitore locale di energia di riferimento. Siamo da sempre parte del Gruppo Canarbino e crediamo nell’importanza di uno sviluppo sostenibile, sia dal punto di vista ambientale sia sociale ed economico. Per continuare su questo percorso, dal 1° ottobre 2024, siamo diventati un brand di Segnoverde SpA Unipersonale. Siamo sempre noi: la proprietà, il gruppo, le persone, la convenienza e l’attenzione al Cliente sono gli stessi. Con questa evoluzione si apre un altro importante capitolo della nostra storia, che segue l’introduzione e la vendita di sistemi di efficientamento energetico.","33167574","Company Hiring Event.

What began as a small team working with a single utility is now a platform used across 15+ markets – supporting millions of households and some of Europe’s most ambitious energy providers. We’re not here to sell dashboards. We’re here to help utilities stay relevant – by making energy feel less like a black box, and more like something customers can control, learn from, and act on.

Romagna Energia è un fornitore di energia elettrica e di gas naturale, si rivolge a tutte le imprese esistenti sul territorio italiano, alle cosiddette utenze ""non civili"".  A oggi è uno dei principali player del mercato energetico nazionale con 500 consorziati e oltre 2000 siti in fornitura (alta, media e bassa tensione), 1,5 miliardi di KWh di energia elettrica dispacciata e un fatturato di circa 191 milioni di euro (anno 2009).  Romagna Energia è il primo consorzio associativo italiano per punti di prelievo e il secondo per volumi di energia; è presente in tutte le regioni d'Italia ed è in continua crescita.  La società è senza scopo di lucro con obiettivo di bilancio zero attraverso ristorni sulla tariffa dell' energia. I soci sono rappresentati dai consumatori stessi, a differenza della maggior parte delle società di vendita presenti sul mercato; l'utente finale non rappresenta solamente un semplice cliente, ma diventa socio di un progetto per fornire energia e servizi di elevata qualità, utilizzando le tecnologie più efficienti e compatibili con l'ambiente.  L'attività di Romagna Energia in ambito energetico non si limita alla sola fornitura di energia e gas, ma offre anche capacità e conoscenze in ambito di fonti rinnovabili, autoproduzione, certificati verdi, ecc.","21580427","","","","","","","","","",""

Onze oplossingen – zoals het Enny Energie Management Systeem (EMS), slimme meters en de modulaire Lewiz Gateway – geven realtime inzicht in verbruik en opwekking. Ze zorgen ervoor dat apparaten automatisch worden aangestuurd op basis van zonneproductie, batterijniveau of dynamische tarieven. Zo vergroten we de zelfconsumptie en verlagen we de energiekosten. Via ons open cloudplatform koppelen we eenvoudig met laadpalen, omvormers, batterijen, warmtepompen en andere slimme apparaten. Dit maakt het mogelijk om energie slim te sturen, zowel op woning- als wijkniveau. Onze technologie is flexibel en schaalbaar, en geschikt voor zowel residentiële als commerciële toepassingen.

(attuale GESAM Reti S.p.A.), il principale brand energetico della città di Lucca. Forniamo da sempre gas naturale, energia elettrica e sistemi di efficientamento energetico a famiglie, imprese e condomini. Siamo partiti dalla Provincia di Lucca e nel tempo siamo cresciuti e abbiamo costruito una rete di sportelli, raggiungendo anche le Province di Pisa e Pistoia. La nostra storia inizia nel 1974 con GESA-AM, quando il Comune di Lucca rileva la rete di distribuzione del gas e diventa il principale fornitore di gas della città murata. Nel 1995 la società si trasforma in GESAM S.p.A. e nel 2003, con la liberalizzazione del mercato del gas, il ramo d’azienda della vendita del gas viene conferito a GESAM Gas S.p.A. Nel tempo la società evolve, cresce e si modifica, nell’assetto e nel parco prodotti offerto alla clientela, fino a diventare nel 2013 GESAM Gas & Luce S.p.A. Un interlocutore esperto, serio e affidabile; un punto di riferimento per migliaia di famiglie, imprese e condomini che affianca alla fornitura di gas naturale quella di energia elettrica e di prodotti ad alta efficienza (Caldaie a condensazione, Climatizzatori, Pompe di calore, Impianti fotovoltaici). Nel 2019 GESAM Gas & Luce entra a far parte del Gruppo Canarbino, tra i primi 10 player del mercato energetico italiano, e dal 1° ottobre 2024, come ultimo step evolutivo, GESAM Gas & Luce ha cambiato denominazione ed è diventata un brand di Segnoverde S.p.A. Unipersonale. Un percorso all’insegna della sostenibilità, centrale nella visione aziendale di GESAM Gas & Luce e del Gruppo Canarbino.","19778535","Company Hiring Event.

For oss er det å redusere strømforbruket et lagarbeid for klimaet og bedre privatøkonomi. Teknologi gir oss gode verktøy for å redusere strømforbruket vårt.

Our name is established by nearly 100 years of masterly excellence and experience in the weaving industry. The highly skilled in-house design team aspires to reinvent itself and refine the designs of today and tomorrow. The entire OSTA team strives to provide the best quality and services for our partnerships around the world. INNOVATION AND DESIGN  For almost 100 years we have specialized in outstanding Belgian design and innovation. The design studio is located in the heart of the showroom. It boasts a tremendous variety of materials, colors, yarns, as well as an extensive library from which to derive inspiration. KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION Our weaving mill is based in Avelgem, mere minutes away from Oudenaarde, which is Flanders’ historical tapestry weaving center. We are proud to continue the fine art of weaving and keep this remarkable legacy alive. Our team aspires to offer the widest possible scope of high-end techniques and textures, ranging from the sophisticated  Jaquard to high-end wilton. We achieve luxurious high pile, elegant cut and loop (commonly referred to as Brussels weave), and even intricate high-performance rugs. The finest materials are selected to weave our products, from natural fibres such as pure wool or cotton to even recycled polyester. OSTA highly values its in-house knowledge, and so the design team joins forces with our skilled master craftsmen to innovate and create the unexpected. RECYCLING AND ECOLOGY Sustainability is key in all our actions. We produce partly our own energy by solar panels which are placed throughout the roof of the factory. The remaining of the energy need is bought from an energy supplier which guarantees the origin from fully renewable power sources (wind and solar energy). And we have our textile waste, paper, cardboard, plastics, pallets, cartridges, batteries and many more recycled.","15479232","Company Hiring Event.

Bij ons geen verhalen over het belang van groene stroom en wat mensen moeten doen om de wereld te redden. Groene stroom is voor ons normaal, geen lifestyle. Ons bedrijf is eenvoudig en efficiënt ingericht, zodat we zo weinig mogelijk kosten hebben. Daarom betaal je ook een lagere prijs voor stroom en gas. 2- Geen gedoe We hebben onze dienstverlening zo efficiënt gemaakt dat je zo weinig mogelijk tijd bij ons verliest. Overstappen. Verhuizen. Alles kan met een paar klikken. We zijn er voor nuchtere mensen: voor iedereen die geen gedoe wil. 3- Vlekkeloze service Elegant krijgt al vanaf de start de hoogste score in de service-vergelijking van de VREG, namelijk 5 sterren. Dit danken we aan onze bijzonder gemotiveerde ""persoonlijke dossierbeheerders"". Elegant heeft geen anoniem callcenter, maar een zeer gemotiveerd team van persoonlijke dossierbeheerders.

PRIMAGAS offers private and commercial customers off-grid energy solutions throughout Germany. For more than 75 years the company, headquartered in Krefeld, has been a reliable and service-oriented partner for all those who rely on environmentally friendly energy. The TÜV NORD certified PRIMAGAS with the seal ""Tested service and installation quality"" as the first liquid gas supplier in Germany high quality in three areas: service, customer satisfaction and installation standards. Around 250 employees in the office and in the field as well as well over 3.000 sales partners for technical customer service provide advice on all questions relating to off-grid gas supply. In addition to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG), PRIMAGAS is the only German energy supplier to offer its customers biogenic LPG (Futuria propane). Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) provides the benefits of gas supply wherever there is no connection to the natural gas grid. It is stored in above-ground or buried tanks directly on site. LPG emits around 15 percent less CO2 than heating oil. Hardly any soot or particulate matter is released during combustion. The energy source evaporates without residue and can even be used in nature and water conservation areas without any restrictions. Liquid gas can be used with all modern heating technologies such as gas condensing boiler technology or combined heat and power units (CHP) and can be combined with renewable energies. Biogenic liquefied petroleum gas: Futuria Propane Since 2018, PRIMAGAS has been the first German supplier to market the renewable energy carrier biogenic liquefied petroleum gas (Futuria Propane). Since November 1, 2020, the GEG recognizes biogenic LPG as a sustainable energy alternative for new buildings.C More information at www.primagas.de and www.futuria-propan.de .","11908469","Company Hiring Event.

De meeste energieleveranciers rekenen een stevige winstopslag bovenop de prijs die zijzelf betalen. Met dat geld, jouw geld dus eigenlijk, financieren ze hun personeel, dure panden en niet te vergeten, de voetbal sponsordeals. Daarnaast werken veel energieleveranciers met lokkertjes: welkomstbonussen en kortingen die je moeten overhalen om te switchen. Al die kosten moeten natuurlijk wel terugverdiend worden, en jij mag raden wie de rekening daarvoor betaalt. Bij easyEnergy vinden we dat onrechtvaardig en doen we het anders. Revolutionair anders. Net als alle andere energieleveranciers koopt easyEnergy haar energie in op de Europese Gas- en Elektriciteitsmarkt. Het grote verschil is echter dat easyEnergy deze beursprijs één-op-één doorgeeft aan al haar klanten, zonder verborgen kosten, nu én in de toekomst. We rekenen een minieme opslag, en we brengen, net zoals elke energieleverancier, vaste leveringskosten in rekening. Bij ons is dat per maand maar 5,00 euro voor groene stroom en 5,00 euro voor gas. Hier doen wij alles voor. Of je nu een nieuwe klant bent of al een tijdje bij ons bent, dat maakt voor ons niet uit. Hierdoor levert easyEnergy blijvend voordelige energie in Nederland.","8959467","","","","","","","","","",""

Ons bedrijf heeft zijn wortels in de elektrosector. Bij de vrijmaking van de energiemarkt hebben we ons, op vraag van onze klanten, meer en meer verdiept in de wereld van de energie. Zo groeiden advies en begeleiding bij de aankoop van energie uit tot onze hoofdactiviteit. Onafhankelijk en onpartijdig Aanvankelijk werkte EVS Energy exclusief samen met enkele energieleveranciers. Die werkwijze gaf ons geen voldoening. Daarom kozen we in 2005 voor een volstrekt onafhankelijke opstelling. Sindsdien werken we met onze klanten samen op contractuele basis. De beste formule voor elke klant Omdat we onafhankelijk en onpartijdig zijn, hebben we geen voorkeur voor één of meerdere energieleveranciers. EVS Energy gaat voor elke klant op zoek naar de beste voorwaarden op de markt, op maat van het profiel van de klant. We baseren ons daarbij op onze grondige marktkennis en op harde data over het energieverbruik van de klant. Geen loze beloftes Geen holle slogans of loze beloftes bij EVS Energy. Voor we met een klant gaan samenwerken, berekenen we of de winst van de klant groter zal zijn dan de kostprijs van onze service. Als dat niet zo is, zeggen we dat vooraf klaar en duidelijk. Winst voor de klant, jaar na jaar Voor tal van bedrijven is de winst hoger (vaak zelfs aanzienlijk hoger) dan de kostprijs die EVS Energy aanrekent. Ook dat wordt vooraf duidelijk gemaakt en aangetoond met harde data. Resultaat: een jarenlange en voor de klant winstgevende relatie. Geen wonder dat EVS Energy zoveel trouwe klanten heeft.","7538085","Company Hiring Event.

Currently the main activity of LITGAS is of strategic importance – the company supplies the minimum required natural gas volume to ensure minimal continuous operation of the Klaipėda’s LNG terminal. From the moment of being appointed as a designated supplier by order of the Minister of Energy ensuring the minimum required gas quantity became the responsibility of LITGAS.   For this purpose on August 21, 2014, after almost a yearlong procurement procedure, a 5-year contract for the supply of 0.54 bcm of natural gas (around 950 thousand cubic meters of LNG) was signed with the Norwegian energy company Statoil.   The designated supplier helps Lithuania to achieve its strategic goals: it creates and supports open access to the global natural gas market, gives the opportunity for suppliers to make use of advantages this market offers, ensures security of supply and promotes real competition on the Lithuanian natural gas market.   In addition to being a designated supplier, LITGAS has ambitions to become a competitive player on the natural gas and LNG supply markets, also pursue growing activities of bunkering, i.e. supply of LNG as fuel for ships. The company has non-binding master agreements for LNG purchases with 15 global suppliers which combined supply more than half of the world’s LNG. These agreements enable quick purchases of gas by LITGAS on international spot markets.","5664006","","","","","","","","","",""

Al na enkele dagen raakt het lichaam in ketose en start de vetverbranding.   Het Cambridge dieet is ontwikkeld aan de universiteit van Cambridge. Doctor Allan Howard verrichtte alles bij elkaar 7 jaar onderzoek naar het dieet, in samenwerking met Addenbrook’s Hospital. Hierover verschenen diverse wetenschappelijke publicaties. De sleutel is het lage percentage koolhydraten. Omdat het lichaam minder koolhydraten binnen krijgt dan het strikt gezien nodig heeft, gaat het lichaam zelf op zoek naar zijn eigen reserves. Wanneer deze op zijn, wordt de volgende energieleverancier in het lichaam aangesproken: overtollig vet! Enkele dagen na het begin van het dieet start de vetverbranding. Dit is een medisch volkomen verantwoorde manier om snel gewicht te verliezen. Intussen krijgt het licham in de vorm van uitgebalanceerde shakes, soepen en repen, alle benodigde voedingsstoffen binnen, inclusief vitaminen en mineralen.  Het dieet is uitsluitend verkrijgbaar via een onafhankelijk Cambridge consulent. Onderzoeken wijzen uit dat het volgen van een dieet onder begeleiding effectiever is, dan zonder begeleiding. Met name de consulenten van Cambridge vormen in dit opzicht een toegevoegde waarde.","5396332","","","","","","","","","",""

Wij geloven dat duurzame warmte iedereen nieuw woongeluk geeft. In energie ligt opnieuw de basis om comfort en welvaart te vergroten. En als nieuwe energie groen is draagt het ook bij aan ons welzijn. Wij vinden het logisch dat Groningers hierin voorop gaan, want hun welzijn staat extra onder druk. Na de gaswinning heeft de regio met de transitie naar duurzame warmte een nieuw perspectief in het vooruitzicht waar we snel werk van willen maken. Zo maken we de transitie eerlijk en veilig, als duurzame aanjager voor wijk en dorpsvernieuwing en blijvend woongeluk. Samen versnellen maakt ons koploper. Het welzijn van Groningers staat bovengemiddeld onder druk, omdat de inkomens relatief laag zijn en energierekeningen juist hoog. Gaswinning heeft in een groot deel van de provincie zijn sporen achtergelaten. Maar ook de vergrijzing is omvangrijker dan in andere delen van Nederland. Het maakt investeren in eveneens oudere woningen moeilijk of niet aantrekkelijk meer. En als het geld en de wil er wel is, dan is verduurzamen vaak lastig. Het lukt velen om verschillende redenen niet om goede stappen te maken. Daar willen we verandering in brengen. Vanuit onze visie heeft Groningen alles in huis om koploper in de transitie te zijn. Alleen door samen op te trekken pakken we problemen aan die grootschalige verduurzaming in de weg staan. Met een krachtige, gezamenlijke aanpak waardoor iedere Groninger mee kan doen. Het transitiecentrum verschaft helderheid en is een gids voor gemeenten, provincie en partners in transitie. Met een praktische en innovatieve aanpak voor de gewenste versnelling.

Uit talloze onderzoeken is gebleken dat er vaak te veel wordt betaald voor gas en elektra. Wij als Groen Eerlijk Nederland hebben dit zelf ook meegemaakt in ons persoonlijk leven. Vaak wordt er gebruik gemaakt van ‘’slapende klanten’’, waar wij zelf ook een van waren.  Wij hebben alle universele behoeften van de consument gerangschikt: hierdoor wordt alles gefilterd en wordt er alleen op maat gewerkt met de klant. Wij bij Groen Eerlijk Nederland geloven erin dat we ervoor kunnen zorgen dat elke klant een fijn gevoel heeft bij hun leverancier én dat het voldoet aan hun eisen en behoeftes. Zowel financieel als op andere vlakken. Dit doen wij op een groene, maar vooral eerlijke manier.","5371164","","","","","","","","","",""

WHAT WE OFFER Energy Analysis - EoT Plus has forged an agreement with the University of Pisa. Any analysis of the customers’ consumption shall be carried out in cooperation with the Department of Engineering, Systems, Territory and Constructions of University of Pisa. Hence EoT Plus is able to supply a service with high technological value and under the scientific supervision of researchers and experts from the sector. Feasibility of proposed actions - following the energy audit, EoT Plus proposes solutions supported by specific feasibility studies for each single project. The proposal describes the most sustainable solutions from a technical, economic and financial point of view. The cooperation with the University of Pisa also extends to this stage: the proposed solutions shall be sustained by strict technical and scientific considerations. Plants for the production of energy from renewable sources - EoT Plus aims to search for technical solutions using plants for the production of energy from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic plants (isolated or connected to the grid) or cogeneration plants, for the production of thermal energy by solar heat.  The possibility to make use of “inexhaustible” sources for self-production allows for an important reduction in the energy supply costs, whether electricity and heat. Energy storage systems - EoT Plus proposes the lithium storage system X-Hybrid series Sk-SU, in conformity with standard CEI 021.  This is the most recent technology in the field of solar inverters, allowing to reduce its dependence on the traditional energy suppliers and to increase the consumption of self-produced energy (minimum 80%). Furthermore, through the Wi-Fi function supplied as standard on the device, it offers remote control from a specific portal. FOR WHOM EoT Plus' capabilities and benefits best suit the following use cases: Industry Each company has specific needs and priorities for customised solutions. As a first step EoT Plus proposes an estimation of the company’s energy consumption. This is then followed by a tailormade action plan to obtain a significant reduction of the energy consumption costs and transforming the company into an ecologically sustainable entity.  EoT Plus wishes to demonstrate that more attention paid to the interests of our planet can represent a key factor for success and increase the competitiveness of businesses. Residential Energy saving is also a very important issue for the final consumer. EoT Plus offers a portfolio of solutions also for residential households. Also in this case, the estimation has proven to be a valuable instrument for the proposal of efficient actions adapted to the specific features of the house that is under consideration. EoT Plus can also be engaged at the design stage of the property, so that efficient and ecologically sustainable energy technologies are built in from the  get-go.","4513148","","","","","","","","","",""

Dát is wat Mega Nederland wil doen.   Sinds februari 2022 kunnen Nederlandse consumenten kiezen voor de goedkopere en groene energie van Mega Nederland. Mega is reeds in België en Frankrijk actief als energieleverancier en meer dan 750.000 klanten profiteren daar al van onze lage tarieven voor stroom en gas.    Hoe we ons precies willen onderscheiden van de rest? Door dezelfde energie, gewoon voordeliger aan te bieden. Om dat te kunnen doen, houden we onze overheadkosten zo laag mogelijk. Onze administratie, IT, marketing en sourcing wordt bijvoorbeeld helemaal geregeld vanuit ons hoofdkantoor in België.   Vanuit ons kantoor in Rotterdam helpen onze lokale medewerkers onze klanten verder met elk aspect van hun energiecontract. Bovendien heeft ons team jarenlange ervaring, zo vermijden we onnodige kosten en kunnen we een vlotte service garanderen.   Daarnaast…  - doen we niet aan kleine letters. We vinden het belangrijk dat ons aanbod voor iedereen duidelijk is.  - vinden we de tijd van onze klanten kostbaar. Daarom sturen we geen ingewikkelde nota’s.   - houden we van het milieu en bieden we groene stroom aan. Op jouw jaarnota lees je vervolgens waar jouw stroom precies vandaan komt.   - zijn we bereikbaar via chat en webform.","3078915","","","","","","","","","",""

ThermoSmart is begonnen met een schone lei en heeft een geheel nieuw thermostaatconcept ontwikkeld met als belangrijkste kenmerken: 1)    eenvoudig in gebruik 2)    altijd en overal te bedienen 3)    helpt besparen 4)    onafhankelijk van energie- en ketelleveranciers. Marktonderzoek 75% van de Nederlandse huishoudens verwarmt  het huis terwijl niemand thuis is. De belangrijkste reden is een onbegrijpelijke thermostaat. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het programmeren op een klein LCD schermpje met veel onduidelijke knoppen. Bovendien blijkt uit onderzoek dat meer dan 50% van de Nederlanders hun thermostaat op afstand wil kunnen bedienen. Crowd funding 2013 Eind 2013 is ThermoSmart succesvol gecrowdfund en bovendien geëindigd in de top 5 van best gefunde projecten in 2013. Mede daardoor is ThermoSmart is onafhankelijk van energieleveranciers en ketelproducenten. Toekomstvisie ThermoSmart is dé thermostaat van nu en van de toekomst. Duurzaam en nooit klaar met leren. Het creëert een online platform dat gebruikservaringen en data om het gemak van de mens te dienen. Daarnaast kunnen er in de toekomst allerlei diensten worden toegevoegd, zoals het aansturen van de CV-ketel op basis van de locatie van de gebruiker en zelflerend vermogen met weersVOORspelling.

The communities are working on saving energy, retrofits, microgeneration and developing plans for renewable energy generation.  The group grew out of Templederry, which is Ireland's first and only community owned wind farm. It is a partnership of community energy groups from Tipperary, Limerick, Galway, Mayo and Dublin and is now working to support more renewable energy projects across Ireland, and will buy electricity from small suppliers.  Last November Community Power was granted a licence to become a large utility supplier.  This is a game changer for community-owned energy generation in Ireland.  Until then Community Power had been buying and selling power between a handful of small renewable generators and a few customers.  Community Power can now take on thousands of customers and can compete on a national footing across the whole of Ireland buying and selling community owned power to and from the people of Ireland. Householders, businesses, farmers, schools etc. throughout Ireland are all being urged to switch suppliers which will in turn enable Community Power to assist other communities develop their own projects. In a market that has been closed to community and citizens for years, this means the door is now firmly open for citizens and communities to benefit from generating their own power. The company wants Ireland to run on clean renewable power, developed for people, owned by people. They recognize Ireland’s energy system is in crisis, with over 90% reliance on climate polluting fossil fuels and they are working to change that. Community Power wants the many benefits of generating renewable power to be shared by the people and communities of Ireland, and they want people to be able to afford to power their homes.","2443491","","","","","","","","","",""

Waarom is NederlandReview opgericht? Wij hebben zelf aardig wat slechte ervaringen (maar gelukkig ook goede) achter de rug als consument. Als wij een slechte ervaring hadden met een bedrijf, kwamen we er achter dat we dit tegen vrienden of familie vertelden, om ze te behoeden voor een eigen misstap. Maar deze bedrijven konden nog altijd gewoon precies dezelfde praktijken verrichten buiten onze vriendenkring om. Er was geen platform om heel Nederland te vertellen dat ze er vooral niet moesten kopen. Maar andersom gold natuurlijk hetzelfde. Wij zijn wel eens ontzettend goed geholpen na een storing bij onze energieleverancier, of hebben toch een flinke korting gekregen toen bleek dat de garantie van onze wasmachine net was verlopen (domme pech!). Ook in dat geval wilden wij heel Nederland vertellen wat voor goede service wij hadden ontvangen. Daarom hebben we NederlandReview opgericht. Want we wilden ergens terecht kunnen met onze positieve en negatieve ervaringen. Wat eerst alleen in een kleine kring bekend was, kan zo heel Nederland bereiken. Bedrijven die hun klanten goed helpen, worden beloond met positieve reviews, geschreven door diezelfde tevreden klanten; klanten die melding willen maken van een bedrijf dat juist in negatieve zin is opgevallen, hebben nu een platform waar hun mening ertoe doet. Heb je zelf ervaringen met één of meerdere bedrijven? Laat een review achter en help mee om anderen te laten weten hoe goed of slecht dit bedrijf is wat betreft bestelgemak, service, prijs en levering! 100% onafhankelijk en objectief NederlandReview","2325896","","","","","","","","","",""

The platform acts as a virtual power plant serving two main customers: 1) Real estate portfolio owners: cities, municipalities, pension funds, BlackRock, and others, can access demand response markets to sell energy flexibility, reduce consumption, and datafy assets without vendor lock-in. 2) Energy companies use the platform for sector coupling, offering automated flexibility services to their end customers in the built environment. A key component is ForeCoop, our IoT bridge (soon on www.truman.cloud), which connects energy assets directly to the cloud. It can be used standalone or integrated with the Energy Coop Platform to enable seamless real-time market participation. ForeCoop is technically advanced, competitively priced, and endorsed by one of Finland’s largest energy companies. Both the platform and ForeCoop operate fully automatically, powered by high-frequency trading bots developed with VTT. These bots perform real-time price bidding, balancing the grid and creating fair market value for buyers and sellers. With renewable energy growth comes volatility, making flexibility crucial for grid stability. Europe’s flexible energy market could reach EUR 90–120 billion by 2035, with buildings as a key source of flexibility. Currently, most building owners lack access to this market and cannot monetize their energy assets. Truman Data builds the Cloud Computing Energy Coop PaaS to enable cities, REITs, housing companies, and energy providers to trade flexible energy, delivering significant economic and climate benefits at scale.","2296320","","","","","","","","","",""

Naast het leveren van energieopslag, elektrificeren wij ook boten. Benieuwd wij wat voor jou kunnen betekenen? Neem gerust contact op. We zitten midden in een energietransitie. We zullen met z’n allen minder energie moeten gaan gebruiken en de energie die we gebruiken zullen we op een verantwoorde manier moeten opwekken. Daarbij komt ook nog eens de explosie van energieprijzen door de oorlog in Oekraïne.  Gelukkig zijn we in Nederland goed bezig want in 2022 zijn al ruim 1.500.000 woningen voorzien van zonnepanelen. Dit is natuurlijk geweldig alleen lopen we wel tegen een aantal beperkingen aan. Door de plaatsing van zonnepanelen, warmtepompen, elektrische verwarmingen en elektrische auto’s loopt het elektriciteitsnet tegen haar grenzen aan en komt het regelmatig voor dat de opgewekte zonne-energie niet terug te leveren is. Daar komt nog eens bij dat veel grote energieleverancier de prijzen voor het terug leveren van energie fors hebben teruggedraaid.   Gevolg is dat zonnepanelen overdag voor een schijntje energie terug leveren aan het net en in de avond voor hoge prijzen energie teruggekocht moet worden. Daarbij komt ook nog eens dat de meeste huishoudens overdag bijna geen stroom verbruiken omdat men overdag aan het werk is en pas in de avond stroom gaan verbruiken voor koken, verlichting, tv kijken, verwarmen, etc. Hoe mooi zou het zijn als je de energie die je opwekt thuis op kan slaan voor eigen gebruik. Amperise Home Batteries heeft hier een betaalbare oplossing voor.  Met de ervaringen die we hebben opgedaan met ons zusterbedrijf Amperaboats op het gebied van elektrisch varen we krachtige en betaalbare Lithium Ijzerfosfaat thuisbatterijen ontwikkeld die aan te sluiten zijn op bestaande zonnepanelen.","1771306","","","","","","","","","",""

De crowdfunding om dit zonnepark te realiseren is afgelopen zaterdag 2 juli gestart op https://www.zonnepanelendelen.nl/project/harlingen en heeft nu al 100 deelnemers. Investeerders kunnen zo 16 jaar lang profiteren van de zonnestroom en daarop een mooi rendement maken dat op kan lopen tot 4,9% per jaar. Iedereen kan aan Zonnepark Harlingen mee doen. Ongeacht waar men woont of bij welke energieleverancier men klant is. Over het zonnepark: Het zonnepark wordt geplaatst op 18.412 vierkante meter grond op industrieterrein Oostpark te Harlingen. Aan de Fahrenheitstraat in Harlingen komen in totaal 3.528 zonnepanelen te liggen. De zonnepanelen hebben gezamenlijk een capaciteit van 952 kWp en zullen in het eerste volledige productiejaar naar verwachting meer dan 1 miljoen kWh opwekken. Gelijk aan het stroomverbruik van 300 huishoudens.  Investeren in het zonnepark kan nu, dit kan al vanaf 25 euro. Het rendement op de investering in ZonneDelen kan in het gunstige geval oplopen tot wel 4,9% per jaar. Zo zorgen we samen voor meer duurzame energie in Nederland.

Het doel van CIRE is het vergroten van de transparantie op en daarmee het vertrouwen in de markt van (intermediaire) verkoop van energiecontracten. Aan de registratie is een onderzoek verbonden. Na registratie doet CIRE onderzoek naar onder meer de directie/eigenaar(s) van de intermediair, het juiste gebruik van handelsnamen, online vindbaarheid, bereikbaarheid voor energieklanten en de reputatie op internet. Daarnaast monitort CIRE op frequente basis de volledigheid, kwaliteit en actualiteit van de gegevens van geregistreerde intermediairs. Intermediairs die aan de vereisten voldoen ontvangen het Transparantiekeurmerk van CIRE. Dit keurmerk zorgt voor transparantie, vertrouwen en meer aandacht voor compliance op de energiemarkt waardoor de verkoopkanalen nu en in de toekomst kwalitatief kunnen blijven worden ingezet.  Sinds 1 april 2020 verplichten alle aangesloten energieleveranciers en platformen - van de Stichting Integriteit en Transparantie Energieadvies - hun directe en indirecte intermediairs dat zij zijn ingeschreven in CIRE.

Een kristalheldere en verfrissende  strategie is voor de oprichters van Naked Energy dan ook de enige juiste.   Een strategie die geen gebruik maakt van deurverkopers, belteams, onduidelijke voorwaarden, dure reclamecampagnes of voorwaardelijke kortingen.    Energie opwekken is verheven tot rocket science en de ontwikkeling van duurzame energie gaat in snel tempo door. Maar tegelijkertijd is met de splitsingswet het opwekken van energie  gescheiden van het leveren van Energie. Naked Energy heeft zich gespecialiseerd in dat laatste stuk, ofwel wij zijn energieleverancier.    De hoge mate van automatisering en sobere marketing maakt Naked Energy een absolute cost leader. De enige manier om op lange termijn een klant van dienst te zijn voor het leveren van een homogeen product als energie, is door het tegen zo laag mogelijke kosten bij de klant te brengen. Daarin is Naked Energy uniek in Nederland. In het verlengstuk van de nuchtere kijk op de wereld levert Naked Energy procentueel net zoveel duurzame energie als dat er opgewekt wordt in Nederland. Je kunt immers niet iets verkopen dat er niet is. Door Naked Energy wordt dus niet aan Green washing gedaan.

PeggyRain® makes outdoor clothes drying simple, practical, and accessible to all, irrespective of a home garden, apartment balcony, or any weather conditions! 🌧 By using PeggyRain instead of a tumble dryer you are helping to reduce your household carbon footprint whilst saving money on electricity bills. PeggyRain is Made in Ireland, with Manufacturing in Dublin and Wicklow and our Marketing team is based in Cork. With PeggyRain it is always a grand day for drying! There are few feelings more painful than sitting down for a nice cup of tea, after putting out all the washing in the back garden, just to see a plethora of rain drench every last piece of your clothing. You find yourself panicking, hastily rushing out trying to rescue anything you can, but it is too late. You stand there, soaking, just about ready to cry. Well wipe your tears because this is where PeggyRain comes in. Peggy Rain is a self-starting clothesline, with innovative technology that automatically releases an integral protective layer on a rainy day. A biodegradable cotton sensor releases a signal if it detects so much as a drop of rain. A waterproof cover is then quickly moved over the clothesline, protecting your clothes. So now next time you’ve set out the washing, and the rain starts pouring down, you can sit back with a smug grin on your face, knowing you were smart enough to choose PeggyRain.","1020689","","","","","","","","","",""

TOTEM ENERGY microcogenerators are the best solution to reduce energy bills while respecting the environment: thanks to an efficiency up to 106% and technologies by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), FPT Industrial and Magneti Marelli developed to meet Euro 6 requirements, asjaGen microcogenerators cut your energy bills, with emissions even lower than a conventional condensing boiler!. TOTEM ENERGY flagship product is the microcogenerator TOTEM: it consists of an internal combustion engine designed to be fired with natural gas, coupled with an alternator for power production: the heat otherwise wasted is recovered from exhaust gases, cooling water and lubricating oils through a heat exchanger system. Such a process is highly efficient (up to 106%) and enables the production of cheap power & heat to meet the end-user demand with great savings. Currently TOTEM is available in 10, 20 and 25 kW electric (respectively 22, 42 and 50 kW thermal).  TOTEM is created to be a benchmark for micro-combined heat & power solutions. Following an approach of extreme quality and transparency TOTEM will indeed be the first microcogenerator in the European market whose performances and compliances are verified and certified by an international certification body. Besides, TOTEM is a great and safe investment: the extremely low operation costs allow a very short payback period (2+ years)! TOTEM ENERGY microcogenerators are developed and produced in a modern factory in Turin (Italy): 2,100 square meters of technology and innovation dedicated to the line TOTEM.

Koncepcja optymalizacji napięcia jest prosta.  Ogólnie, rzecz biorąc moc z krajowej sieci energetycznej jest dostarczana z wyższym napięciem niż jest to konieczne ze względu na stosowane stare elektryczne sieci dystrybucyjne , które zostały zaprojektowane do pracy na wyższych poziomach napięcia, jak również dostawce energii są  zobowiązani do zapewnienia, że do wszystkich budynków dostarczane jest napięcie z właściwymi parametrami.Jeżeli budynek zasilany jest wyższym napięciem niż jest to konieczne, prawdopodobnie spowoduje to marnowanie energii, nadmierne poziomy emisji CO2 oraz wyższe niż jest to konieczne rachunki za energię elektryczną, oprócz kwestii związanych z jakością energii, zwiększonym zużyciem oraz krótszym czasem użytkowania urządzeń elektrycznych. Oprócz zmniejszenia zużycia energii, redukcji emisji dwutlenku węgla i zapewnienia oszczędności na rachunkach za energię elektryczną, optymalizacja napięcia może również poprawić jakość zasilania dzięki zrównoważeniu napięć fazowych ,filtrowaniu harmonicznych oraz napięcia przejściowego dostawców sieci.Technologie optymalizacji napięcia są zazwyczaj instalowane szeregowo między transformatorem rozdzielczym a główną rozdzielnicą niskiego napięcia, dzięki czemu wszystkie urządzenia odbiorcy mogą korzystać z optymalnego zasilania.  Istnieją dwa typy systemów optymalizacji napięcia, do których ogólnie się odwołuje przy omawianiu tego podejścia ”Sztywny” Powerstar LITE, który optymalizuje napięcie o określoną wartość i dopasowuje do profilu przychodzącego lub „Elektroniczny – dynamiczny” Powerstar MAX, który wykorzystuje inteligentne elementy sterujące w celu optymalizacji napięcia i utrzymania go na stałym poziomie. W przypadku większych obiektów, na których pracują własne infrastruktury WN/NN, po stronie WN można zainstalować system Powerstar HV MAX, aby poprawić problemy z zasilaniem źródłowym poprzez wymianę aktualnego transformatora WN na transformator z super niskimi stratami amorficznymi rdzenia i zintegrowanie go z technologią optymalizacji napięcia.

Op deze manier kunnen warmteproducenten, zoals bijvoorbeeld een lokale energiecoöperatie, maar ook bedrijven én buurtbewoners zelf restwarmte aanbieden aan de buurt. De gemeente kan in samenwerking met gespecialiseerde marktpartijen de benodigde infra in de vorm van een dienst aanbieden aan een grote groep buurtbewoners. Op deze manier wordt de overstap naar aardgasvrij financieel aantrekkelijk. Crowdheating.com verzorgt de bemiddeling tussen de crowd (de buurt) en marktpartijen. De crowd kiest in overleg met de gemeente één netwerkbeheerder. De netwerkbeheerder is verantwoordelijk voor de ontwikkeling en exploitatie van het netwerk. Marktpartijen ontvangen geen informatie die te herleiden is tot een individueel huis of persoon. De aanbiedingen van leveranciers worden gepubliceerd op de online marktplaats. Op deze manier kiezen consumenten zélf met welke leveranciers en energieproducenten men in zee wil gaan. Snel, duidelijk en transparant! Het de taak van het ‘netwerk’ om vraag en aanbod te balanceren middels bijvoorbeeld een seizoensopslag. Dit biedt consumenten keuzevrijheid. Dit in tegenstelling tot de traditionele warmtenetten en stadswarmte, traditionele warmtenetten en stadswarmte, waarbij er sprake is van slechts één of enkele warmteproducenten (monopolisten).","521531","","","","","","","","","",""

L’idea di base è stata quella di aggregare un notevole numero di clienti della T&G Sistemi, oggi Electric Power, azienda leader nel settore elettrico dove lavorarono alcuni membri del Team, al fine di perseguire il motto “l’unione fa la forza” per poter spuntare ottimi prezzi e garanzie contrattuali. Dal 1º luglio 2004 tale fascia si è allargata ulteriormente permettendo a tutti i possessori di partita IVA di poter accedere al Libero Mercato. L'ultima barriera alla liberalizzazione è caduta il 1º luglio 2007 quando anche per le utenze domestiche è stato aperto il mercato. Il crescente numero di aziende che hanno voluto partecipare al gruppo d’acquisto ha portato nel 2008 la nascita del Consorzio Energia 2000. Ad oggi gestisce la quantità di energia consumata da circa 25.000 famiglie italiane. Nel 2016 sono uscite le prime notizie sul termine del mercato di Maggior Tutela e arrivano i primi contatti. A gennaio 2017 il Team ha iniziato a porre le basi su come affrontare la chiusura del Servizio di Maggior Tutela e su come creare il primo grande Gruppo d’Acquisto per clienti domestici e piccole imprese. Il 4 agosto 2017, dopo due anni, 4 mesi e due giorni, il Senato ha dato la fiducia al Governo approvando il Ddl Concorrenza, che sancisce la fine del Mercato di Maggior Tutela a partire da luglio 2019. Tutti i clienti residenziali saranno sul Mercato Libero e dovranno scegliere il loro fornitore di energia elettrica. Dal mese di Novembre 2017 è online la prima versione del sito internet www.grupacq.energy che si occupa di gestire al meglio il primo Gruppo d’Acquisto Energetico per piccoli consumatori.","497436","","","","","","","","","",""

With lightweight-category vehicles such as mopeds, scooters, motorcycles, tricycles and quadricycles. By common battery specifications, the introduction of swappable battery stations will be facilitated. This is seen to be key to the development of low-voltage electromobility. This technology will only perform at its best if a common ground is found, and  common international standards can be adopted globally. For this reason, main players of the industry have founded the Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium in September 2021. The Consortium was then soon joined by other members and intends to gather all the know-how, expertise and best practices necessary to define and promote common technical specifications and components for the best and fastest way to achieve a workable electrification. This international and diversified partnership of vehicle and batteries manufacturers, energy providers, research institutes and associations, will address the main needs of customers and offer a user-friendly solution for urban mobility. The motorcycle industry clearly understands that electromobility will play a key role in the future transport of people and goods.  By working together on common battery specifications, this will allow and enable the introduction of swappable battery stations in an efficient way.  Swappable batteries allow riders to exchange their vehicle’s batteries at battery stations for fully charged ones. Instead of a full tank of gas, the clients get a fresh battery. Easy and convenient! Swappable battery technology will drastically shorten charging time, delete range anxiety, and reduce costs for the final users. Moreover, it will facilitate the re-use and re-purpose of batteries for a second life.","395936","","","","","","","","","",""

Airtight eliminates the waste. Global energy consumption has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades – especially in emerging markets. Buildings are responsible for about a third of all energy consumed in the world, with heating and cooling accounting for half of that consumption. With all the energy spent on heating and cooling buildings, however, as much as 25 per cent is wasted on air leakage. This equals an annual waste of USD 500 billion. Airtight has developed a solution for establishing a detailed “leakage signature” for individual buildings. The signature is a comprehensive analysis of energy waste. Taking the leakage signature as a starting point, Airtight uses real-time monitoring and machine learning to recommend adjustments to heating and cooling systems. This way, Airtight ensures that each centimetre of a building is fine-tuned to minimise energy waste. By pooling data from large numbers of both leaky and non-leaky buildings, Airtight is moreover able to generate in-depth insight to benefit all its customers. The Airtight system lowers energy bills, improves indoor air quality and increases the lifespan of a building. If Airtight were implemented in every building across the globe, the current annual waste of USD 500 billion would be halved. Additionally, energy use would be cut by 2.5 per cent and greenhouse gas emissions cut by 2 per cent. The International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identify building airtightness as one of the most cost-efficient ways to cut energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. In the EU alone, there is 25 billion square metres of air-conditioned building space that needs to be made airtight. Airtight is a Norwegian start-up based at StartupLab in Oslo. Its solution has been awarded the Seal of Excellence under the EU’s Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Phase 2.","107827","","","","","","","","","",""

A stable and low energy bill for 25 years and 100% Green?  Gloww delivers electricity at a lower price than conventional electric companies. Our secret? Solar energy! This green technology doesn't receive the same subsidies as they did a few years ago and yet... It's still much cheaper than classic energy production. Why? Solar panels got much cheaper and more efficient. Furthermore: Your electricity is generated on your own roof. This saves you a great deal on distribution costs. And these costs - brace yourselves- make up to 45 to 65% of your classic energy cost.  Gloww provides its customers with free solar panels for a fixed fee that's cheaper than your conventional energy bill. ******************************************************************************************************************** Woww! Een lage energiefactuur, 25 jaar lang en 100% groen. Gloww levert elektriciteit aan een lager tarief dan klassieke energieleveranciers. Dat kan omdat de elektriciteit wordt geproduceerd met zonnepanelen. Deze groene technologie krijgt vandaag geen subsidies meer en is toch goedkoper dan de klassieke stroomopwekking. Waarom? Zonnepanelen zijn een stuk goedkoper en efficiënter geworden. Bovendien wordt de elektriciteit ter plaatse opgewekt. Dat bespaart een smak geld op de distributiekosten. En – hou u vast – distributiekosten bepalen voor 45 tot 65% de klassieke stroomprijs. U krijgt van Gloww een tweemaandelijkse factuur, zonder verrassingen.","","Company Hiring Event.

Hur skulle det vara om ert IT stöd kom som en tjänst med en fast månadskostnad?    Vår erfarenhet visar att många företag sitter med IT produkter som är lite förlegade både vad gäller ålder samt hur de förvaltas. Med en lösning från Asperis så behöver du inte äga någon hårdvara till slut.  En stor elleverantör genomförde för några år sedan en framgångsrik kampanj: El kommer från ”Två hål i väggen”. På samma sätt kan vi leverera IT samt det stöd som behövs.  Har du en fungerande IT miljö idag så behöver du inte genomföra resan till 100%  från dag ett, men vi kan börja den tillsammans. Inga tagna investeringar skall behöva gå förlorade.   Med Asperis som leverantör så lovar vi att utveckla, leverera och förvalta: •         En mycket modern samt homogen IT miljö •         God prestanda •         All data/information säkrad och verifierad  •         Full kontroll på alla licenser. •         Snabb support vid behov •         En känd månadskostnad där allt ingår   Våra lösningar baseras på det vi kan och har erfarenhet av.  Asperis har nödvändiga certifieringar samt är partner hos alla stora leverantörer såsom Microsoft, HP m. fl.    När vi får ett förtroende att leverera så genomför vi det med kvalitet samt med sikte en långsiktig relation.   Asperis strävar alltid efter att vara ”Er fasta punkt” inom IT.   Vi hoppas du kan avvara en timme av din dyrbara tid där vi kan få berätta mer?","","","","","","","","","","",""

We are an Independent Global Organization which facilitates interactively residential electricity supply to families facing financial hardship. Working together with our donors, electricity providers, social welfare organisations and local authorities, we help to alleviate part of the incurred electricity debt and enable those in need to be re-connected to the power grid and potentially enter into a debt repayment structure. The objective of ElectricityTrust is not to pay someone’s outstanding electricity bills but rather to assure electricity supply where it’s needed most. How does it work? The collaborating Social Welfare Organisations (including Local Authorities and Religious Groups) provide the ElectricityTrust with priority lists of prospect candidates. This information is cross referenced and verified with data provided by the Electricity Suppliers to ensure the correct allocation of Electricity Months (EMs) to the prospect recipients. (EMs correspond to average electricity consumption by customers per month.) Upon verification and package cost negotiations with the Electricity Suppliers, a re-connection/supply order is generated (the execution of which is subsequently confirmed by the participating Social Welfare Organisation). The process is totally transparent to the participating Institutions guaranteeing the integrity of the platform and the donation-allocation-receipt network. How to donate? Donations are accepted from individuals and from any major or minor corporation as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. Donations can be made nominally or anonymously however in any case, the ElectricityTrust process of receipt and distribution will be transparent and traceable by the benefactor (in accordance with the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, of the European Union). When you think of it, you know you have all the good reasons to help disadvantaged fellow citizens.","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zu den mitwirkenden namhaften Unternehmen, die in Thüringen verwurzelt sind, gehören Netzbetreiber, Energie- und Stromanbieter sowie Spezialisten für erneuerbare Energien. Seit 2021 treiben wir den Ausbau einer nachhaltigen Wasserstoffinfrastruktur voran. Der nächste Schritt, sobald die erforderliche Struktur fest etabliert, ist: Ab 2025 soll grün produzierter Wasserstoff aus lokal erzeugtem Grünstrom eingesetzt werden können. Transportiert wird der Wasserstoff mit einer 42 Kilometer langen H2-Leitung. Hierfür nutzen wir eine bereits bestehende Gasleitung mit einem Leitungsdurchmesser von 600 mm. Zusätzlich wird ein 3 km langer Leitungsabschnitt neu gebaut, der den Wasserstoff zu den Abnehmern bringt. Begleitend binden wir einen H2-Porenspeicher ein, wodurch Wasserstoff auch bei saisonalen Schwankungen zur Verfügung steht. Es erfolgt der Anschluss an das Heizkraftwerk in Erfurt, dessen H2-Brenner eine Leistung von 20 MWth für die Erzeugung von Fernwärme erbringt. Darüber hinaus schließen wir einen Teil des Erfurter Gasnetzes an – beide Maßnahmen verringern den CO2-Ausstoß um 16.800 Tonnen pro Jahr. Sukzessive kommen weitere Anwendungen dazu: Wir planen mittelfristig, das Industriegebiet am Erfurter Kreuz sowie den Schienenverkehr anzubinden und den H2-Einsatz im Erfurter Stadtnetz sowie im Heizkraftwerk zu erhöhen. Wir fokussieren uns dabei u. a. auf die Ausdehnung der H2-Infrastruktur und den Anschluss an das deutsche und europäische H2-Backbone-Netz. **  Impressum & Datenschutz / Imprint & data privacy: https://www.th2eco.de/impressum   **","","","","","","","","","","",""

Energieleveranciers die onmogelijke eisen stellen, verzekeraars die een cliënt weigeren wegens wanbetaling uit het verleden. Wanneer iemand onder bewind gesteld wordt, resulteert dit vaak in krampachtige reacties van bedrijven, die niet begrijpen dat de tussenkomst van een bewindvoerder juist zorgt voor meer zekerheid en stabiliteit.

Aiuto aziende, fornitori e agenti nelle strategie di acquisizione clienti migliorando i processi operativi, la fidelizzazione e il passaparola. Io li chiamo ""Clienti che vendono""! Con Revoluce provo a rivoluzionare il mercato energetico. E' la prima energia ricaricabile con un prezzo al kWh tutto incluso e senza costi fissi. Acquisiamo clienti con strategie avanzate di Web Marketing e Lead Generation. In poco più di un anno abbiamo acquisito oltre 1.000 clienti online (di cui il 67% ci presenta ad amici e parenti) e siamo la prima pagina Facebook nel settore energy per tasso di engagement. La competenza specialistica nel settore energetico mi ha aiutato a creare una società di service per 7 fornitori di energia elettrica e gas. Grazie a software proprietari e procedure standardizzate gestiamo a costi competitivi e in outsourcing tutte le attività di backoffice, operation, fatturazione e customer care. Posso dire di aver ""trasformato"" degli agenti in veri e propri fornitori di energia che oggi fatturano milioni di euro.
