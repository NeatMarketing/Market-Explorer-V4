Se alla nascita erano soprattutto i sacchi frigo, la produzione di Virosac si è poi notevolmente allargata arrivando a comprendere ogni tipo di sacco per i rifiuti (dal piccolo sacco in Mater-Bi per il rifiuto umido fino ai grandi sacchi ultraresistenti per il rifiuto secco del condominio) e tantissime soluzioni diverse per la cucina, il guardaroba, il giardino.  Ma la peculiarità di Virosac è la capacità di creare prodotti nuovi: è il caso ad esempio del sistema brevettato Lacciosac per la chiusura più pratica dei sacchetti, la saldatura antigoccia che evita le rotture, lo Stopsac oltre al Saccofrigo con laccetto già incorporato nel sacco.

No, it is the natural evolution of the project that began five years ago with the creation of replustissue, specialising in high-tech mechanical and plant solutions alongside Eil, which focused on automation, electrifications and air systems. A perfect synergy between the two teams has now culminated in their unification under a single name: EilReplus, a synthesis of expertise, tailor-made engineering capabilities, and a renowned commitment to close collaboration with clients, a unique soft skill in the landscape of tissue paper machinery manufacturers. The people at EilReplus are the differentiating factor: their deep understanding of the market and industry trends has given them a clear perspective on the challenges increasingly affecting tissue paper producers. Among these, the lack of flexibility and proximity to customers from major players designing and developing tissue production plants stood out. Founded with a clear mission: to ensure quality and performance by starting from customers’ needs and operating conditions, always putting the client at the centre of processes and design approach, supporting them at every stage of their investment. Meeting EilReplus, one immediately senses the genuine enthusiasm of a team bringing a fresh yet highly solid approach to the sector.

During this period they discovered several problems linked to many factory’s compressed air distribution systems. The traditional pipework distribution systems, such as Black and Galvanised steel, had many limitations and restrictions for the distribution of Compressed Air such as low flow rates, high pressure drop, corrosion, fluid contamination and major difficulties in modifying the installations.  As a solution to solve these problems, Teseo began to design and develop a modular aluminium pipework system for the distribution of compressed air. In the early 90’s Teseo were the first company to successfully develop and bring to market a Modular Aluminium Pipework System specifically designed for the distribution of Compressed Air and other fluids.  Combining the features of a structural profile together with the full flow of a pipe, Teseo achieved one of the most innovative systems for fluid power distribution.  Modern high tech designs, easy to use and flexible were the main features to claim everyone’s attention. Today Teseo is a modern and dynamic company with an active and motivated sales and management team. Our Technical department have a passion for continuously improving and developing our existing range of products, forward thinking and striving to develop new ranges to meet our customers’ future needs and requirements.","9181108","Company Hiring Event.

La flessibilità, la dinamicità e l’attenzione al cliente sono i fattori sui quali l’azienda investe per offrire un prodotto competitivo e di qualità.   SISTEMI  Per stare al passo con le esigenze odierne l’azienda ha sviluppato in questi ultimi anni sistemi di automazione per l’organizzazione aziendale: E.G. Data System è un sistema modulare per raccogliere e controllare dati ed informazioni e per segnalare eventuali problemi provenienti da singole macchine industriali o da interi settori produttivi. Tutto ciò può comodamente essere visualizzato da computer o I-Pad e non serve alcun tipo di cablaggio poiché il sistema funziona attraverso un sistema di rete wi-fi o radio modem. E.G. Eco System è un programma di interventi atti all’abbattimento dei consumi di energia elettrica fino al 50% in ogni reparto produttivo di un impianto industriale. Il sistema si basa sull’interruzione delle fasi di lavoro di quei dispositivi che restano in funzione anche quando non è presente materiale da lavorare e sull’ottenimento di una maggiore efficienza dei sistemi di aspirazione, di macinazione e di illuminazione.   RETROFIT L’azienda si propone inoltre di rimettere in efficienza qualsiasi tipo di macchinario industriale riparandolo o sostituendo componenti obsoleti o danneggiati per poi riprogrammarlo e metterlo in funzione. Attualmente sono stati riportati in piena efficienza pallettizzatori, presse, forni e macchinari di carico e scarico box.

The expertise and innovation spirit and talents of these young people gave rise to a firm that soon became a leader in the sector of harvesting and seeding machines. This perfect combination has given a market, that was still poor in terms of mechanisation, new machines carefully designed from a mechanical and practical standpoint and completely innovative in their functional characteristics. The excellent market response led to ORTOMEC being now present as a manufacturer and distributor company all over the world, capable to tailor its machines to the most varied customers needs, covering a range of different soils and countries. The company is supported by a valid technical department, in charge of planning and developing and equipped with the most advanced computer systems. It can also rely on a large factory space, with several departments where the machines are built and assembled. In the last few years Ortomec showed its reliability and standards by perfecting its machines and diversifying its product range with even more advanced accessories, introducing and launching new prototypes, always well received by the market.","5516905","","","","","","","","","",""

Una nostra particolarità è che tutte le lavorazioni dei nostri prodotti stampati, dalla fotocomposizione, alla rilegatura, fino alla preparazione e alla spedizione, incluse stampa a caldo o plastificazione, sono realizzate internamente, il che permette un controllo di qualità su tutti i processi produttivi della stampa di altissimo livello. L'offset è un processo di stampa su rulli del tipo indiretto, quindi l’immagine non è trasferita direttamente dalla lastra alla carta ma attraverso un complesso sistema di rulli, ideale per stampe ad alta definizione e su superfici irregolari. Quella UV/LED è una tecnologia rivoluzionaria che consente di  stampare direttamente su qualsiasi supporto, con qualità fotografica e asciugatura immediata. Permette di sostituire sistemi come serigrafia, tampografia o sublimazione ed è il massimo per il  mondo della pubblicità e degli articoli personalizzati. Il processo di stampa digitale si basa sull’utilizzo di file digitali che vengono trasferiti direttamente alla stampante tramite processi elettronici, senza l’utilizzo di lastre e matrici. Il passaggio dei file dal computer alla stampante è immediato, garantendo così un’ottimizzazione dei tempi di realizzazione del lavoro e una resa qualitativamente migliore rispetto alla stampa tradizionale. La digitale è una tecnica di stampa diretta: il documento da stampare (qualsiasi tipo di testo o immagine), dopo essere stato lavorato tramite appositi software, viene impresso direttamente sul supporto di stampa attraverso getto di inchiostro. Utilizziamo plotter con tecnologia a getto d’inchiostro unita a una funzione di taglio (sagomatura o scontorno) che stampano, oltre che sui comuni materiali come banner, carta e tele artistiche, anche e principalmente su vinili e adesivi.","5382664","","","","","","","","","",""

Il secondo passo è stata la creazione di un negozio dedicato, questa volta, esclusivamente all'audio e al car di qualità. Da questo momento il negozio sito in Via Feltre si allarga sempre di più aggiungendo metri espositivi e altre tipologie di prodotti tra cui elettrodomestici e informatica raggiungendo, su 650 metri quadri di esposizione, il format di negozio di elettronica vero e proprio. Nel 1994 viene aperta in Cadore la nuova sede della catena ""Idea Musica"", questa volta su una superficie di 400 mq, più piccola ma altamente specializzata. Nel 2006 la catena apre il suo negozio più grande al centro commerciale Veneggia, questa volta su una superficie di 1000 metri quadri e con un'esposizione ed una scelta molto più ampia, ma sempre con l'attenzione alla qualità della vendita e alla soddisfazione del cliente. Nel dicembre del 2009 viene rilevato il negozio di Ponte nelle Alpi, ex “Comprameglio”, che aggiunge 800mq e una scelta di prodotti che punta maggiormente alla qualità. Oggi, quindi, Idea Musica rappresenta il marchio Expert e, con un totale di 2400mq espositivi, il maggior player nel mercato dell'elettronica di consumo in provincia di Belluno.","5382664","","","","","","","","","",""

Our technicians are always searching for new technologies, to optimize, towards chargers, performances and life of batteries theselves. In particular, the strategy of collaboration established during these years with the dealers of forklift trucks, in the national and international market has led us to a continuous evolution and to the verification of the chargers producted by TCE. So it's possible to have adequate methods of charghing batteries. Our goal is to obtain a high energy efficency and longevity for the battery itself, with more autonomy for the forklift truck. During the year 2012, our technicians designed the new version “Evolution” of the charger. To solve the flying wires problem, that are often thrown to the ground, with the conseguence of damaging the connector of charger, they have produced an ""Easy Wire"" siystem: at the and of the charging process the wire fallss directly back in its special housing itself, to preserve the entirety of the cable.

Unlike traditional fire suppression technologies—which activate only after a fire has started—our innovative approach prevents fires from occurring in the first place. This proactive method eliminates fire hazards entirely, safeguarding people, buildings, and their valuable contents. Traditional fire suppression methods—using foam, water mist, sprinklers, gas, or water—are reactive and often cause significant collateral damage. In many critical applications such as data centers, server rooms, cold stores, or paper mills, these methods can result in catastrophic consequences. For example, water and electricity are incompatible, and flooding large cold storage facilities with gas is impractical. Isolcell’s N₂ Oxygen Reduction System® provides the optimal solution by creating an environment where fires cannot ignite. This highly reliable, flexible, and scalable system is tailored to meet the needs of a wide range of industries, offering unparalleled protection for sensitive environments. Applications: LOGISTICS: Automated and intensive warehouses Storage of hazardous materials Cold, frozen, and refrigerated warehouses Food warehouses Paper mills IT & POWER SUBSTATIONS: Data centers Server and computer rooms Switch rooms and shelters Substations and transformer rooms ARCHIVING: Paper files and film archives Museums Hospital warehouses Libraries Vaults and treasuries With Isolcell's N₂ Oxygen Reduction System®, fire prevention becomes proactive and comprehensive, offering unmatched peace of mind in protecting life, property, and business continuity.""","5085690","Company Hiring Event.

È il 1973 quando Stelio Maggiori installa i primi distributori automatici di caffè e bevande calde negli ospedali di San Gimignano e Colle Val d’Elsa. Diba continua la sua storia di successi e soddisfazioni dimostrandosi capace di individuare e di capire in anticipo i mutamenti e il comportamento del mercato: Stelio Maggiori e Claudio Guazzini sono i primi a promuovere la commercializzazione dei nuovissimi sistemi in cialda Illy e Lavazza. Siamo nel 1992 quando Diba intraprende questa scelta di mercato, controcorrente rispetto ai propri competitor. Da segnalare in questo cammino la nuova e moderna struttura aziendale inaugurata nel 2006 e il punto vendita al dettaglio. La lungimiranza e la capacità dei soci di Diba70 hanno fatto sì che l’azienda continuasse il proprio percorso sulla strada del successo fino al 2013 con l’apertura del nuovo punto vendita al dettaglio. Filosofia guida di questa esperienza è il motto “provare per credere”, esempio lampante dello spirito con cui l’azienda intende creare, mantenere e custodire il rapporto con i propri clienti, custodendo la dimensione familiare dell’azienda. Dimostrandosi nuovamente una realtà capace di stare al passo coi tempi, Diba70 oggi decide di aprire un e-commerce online sul proprio sito, confermandosi ancora come una realtà flessibile e al passo coi tempi e con le esigenze dei propri clienti. Durante il 2020 le nostre abitudini quotidiane e i modi di stare insieme sono cambiati radicalmente. Se in precedenza le relazioni umane si costruivano intorno a una macchina del caffè, intorno a un distributore automatico, o seduti a un tavolo, ora tutto è diverso: non lo è però, la voglia di costruire e coltivare questi rapporti. Continuiamo a prendere il caffè in compagnia, anche se separati dallo schermo di un computer.","4279410","","","","","","","","","",""

Industrial automation can be defined as the creation of the technologies necessary for the management and control of production processes. This technology uses mechanical, electronic and computer technologies for the control of industrial production processes and is a technical procedure that identifies all that is necessary to make a machine or process work without human intervention, that is, automatically. This modern technique arises from the ever stronger need to have ever faster and more precise machines to optimize production times and reduce the risk of error that human input can entail. The main objective of automation is therefore to replace man in repetitive tasks, with machinery capable of operating autonomously or with an ever lower demand for human input. A real branch of modern engineering has been created from this new company management, which constantly studies its application in the industrial field. Tecnotrasmissioni Due Srl provides technical support for the configuration of products suitable for improving and making the management of some parts of the supply chain autonomous, we design the machinery and distribute the material we keep in delivery, having a large owned warehouse.

E' stata una delle prime aziende a comprendere il vero potenziale che si trovava nella tecnologia della pesatura multiteste. Nel 1979, Yamato Scale ha introdotto la prima pesatrice multiteste dotata di celle di carico. Nel 1988, la Yamato è stata la prima azienda al mondo a creare un miscelatore software per pesatrici multiteste per una precisa pesatura di applicazioni miste. L’introduzione del touch screen della console di comando nel 1989 ha rivoluzionato la gestione e il controllo della pesatrice multiteste. Nel 1981 Yamato ha introdotto la funzione “Operazione doppio spostamento”, consentendo di realizzare una velocità di 120 pesate al minuto (wpm), che nel 1984 è stata portata a 160 pesate al minuto con una bilancia 16-teste con cestelli di memoria di nuova concezione. L’anno successivo, la Yamato ha introdotto una bilancia 10-teste con cestelli di memoria e dimensioni compatte in grado di raggiungere una velocità fino a 130 pesate al minuto. Il lancio della Serie Sigma F1 Frontier nel 2005 ha rivoluzionato la tecnologia della pesatrice multiteste, permettendo la pesatura rapida, precisa e sicura di applicazioni nuove. Nel 2008, la Yamato utilizza l’opportunità dell’Interpack per dimostrare ancora una volta la sua innovativa ingegnosità con l’introduzione della ADW F528SVD, un concetto rivoluzionario per una pesatrice a 28-teste. Dal 1986, Yamato è stata la forza trainante nel campo della tecnologia della pesatura multiteste in Germania. Dal 1992, la sede Yamato a Willich, Germania, ospita i dipartimenti vendite, marketing, amministrazione e servizio, oltre al laboratorio delle prove, ed è responsabile dell’intero mercato Europeo, Africano, del Medio e Vicino Oriente, nonché per i mercati dei paesi della CSI. Yamato Scale GmbH ha filiali in Francia, Regno Unito, Russia, Benelux, e dal 2016 anche in Italia.

A careful study of the design led to the creation of the first infra-red lamp, specifically meant for drying printing inks. This item became a standard product and a reference point for quality and reliability both in Italy and abroad. In 1988, the Company moved to Rio Saliceto to satisfy the demands of a constant and unexpected growth in production. Since then, the Company has constantly maintained its objectives of quality and reliability, guaranteeing functional products designed in compliance with the latest safety standards. In addition to the line of products meant for the screen printing sector, a new line was introduced meant for the embroidery sector. The result was the innovative Speedy ""T"", a machine capable of folding and packing clothing items in bags with considerable savings in terms of time and money, thus solving the problems of an increasingly demanding clientele. In 2007, the Company moved again, this time to Correggio, to a new industrial building more in keeping with the current logistic and production requirements.

Grazie a Hobby & Legno, è finalmente possibile acquistare questi mobili senza rinunciare alla convenienza che solo un centro bricolage può offrire. Il punto vendita si distingue anche per la gamma di servizi altamente professionali associati alla vendita, ovvero la progettazione, la consulenza sull'uso dei prodotti, il taglio di pannelli, il sezionamento e la lavorazione del materiale, la consegna e la messa in opera. Non a caso Hobby & Legno annovera fra i clienti, in aggiunta alle famiglie e agli enti pubblici e privati, i professionisti del settore arredamento e gli artigiani, che qui trovano un partner affidabile, in grado di offrire assistenza, qualità e convenienza.","3789730","","","","","","","","","",""

MArteLabel today brings on the table an hybrid approach, where the album production is NOT the ultimate aim, but just one of multiple steps of an open minded, consistent and sustainable management strategy regarding a particular music proposal.  MArteLabel also focus on forming new actors in the managerial music field. Since 2008, the label has been staging professional training courses for producers and music events planners, in order to offer new job opportunities to  young enthusiasts. Course participants will be provided of a deep knowledge about the musical events industry, the production and management of an artist and, above all, will take the opportunity to train themselves within our structure through a training internship. MArteLabel is currently working on some recording projects: Gli Scontati, Dellera, UNA, Mammooth, Gianluca De Rubertis, Giacomo Toni, Anudo, Petramante.

L’ufficio tecnico studia attrezzature e macchine speciali oltre a nuove teste e comandi elettronici, che prima di essere commercializzati sono testati prima nel proprio laboratorio e poi presso alcuni clienti amici che si prestano a fare da “cavie” cercando di trovare eventuali difetti e proporre migliorie. Il laboratorio serve anche per la prova di nuove leghe di elettrodi. La possibilità di collegare varie teste di saldatura a differenti taglie di trasformatori e a diverse tecnologie (inverter media e alta frequenza, corrente alternata e raddrizzata, ecc.), permette di eseguire tutti i test di fattibilità, campionature e piccole preserie, cosicché il cliente veda immediatamente se la soluzione proposta è quella più idonea alle proprie esigenze e possa continuare con proprie prove e/o test. Gli oltre 30 anni di esperienza e le continue collaborazioni con altre aziende costruttrici di linee e macchine di assemblaggio hanno fatto nascere delle sinergie che vanno a vantaggio del cliente che, volendo, può avere un unico interlocutore per una soluzione che prevede tecnologie di saldatura abbinate ad altre lavorazioni: avvolgimento, stampaggio, montaggio, lavorazioni meccaniche di tranciatura, piega, deformazione, ecc.","3693211","Company Hiring Event.

The machine is able to recognise the product entering or leaving the warehouse simply by recognising its label. As a human would do. This product, which is patent pending, is particularly useful when the use of barcode is not possible or too complex (e.g. cellar management).","3405370","","","","","","","","","",""

La vera forza sta proprio nei valori condivisi e nella cooperazione di gruppo, infatti pur essendo una piccola realtà come gruppo ma non troppo piccola come azienda, possiamo pensare come una multinazionale, senza averne i difetti: infatti riusciamo a essere molto flessibili, dinamici e, sopratutto, a dimensione umana, condizioni che oggi, in un mondo di spersonalizzazione e call-center, ci permette di essere ancora vicini al cliente e  di continuare ad investire nella nostre idee e avere fiducia nel futuro.      Il gruppo è un Family Business che fa capo alla famiglia Campinoti, sino dalla sua fondazione nel lontano 1967, quando il fondatore Francesco Campinoti , tecnico fuori dal suo tempo, perseguendo  un sogno costituì la C.E.A.M. Acronimo di Costruzioni Elettriche Apparecchi di Misura, ed iniziò a progettare e produrre artigianalmente innovativi sensori di temperatura prevalentemente per il settore del Vetro e della Ceramica, molto presenti nell’area all’epoca. Oggi il gruppo è sempre attivo nel settore originale della strumentazione industriale e del controllo di processo con la CEAM Control Equipment, che rappresenta ancora l’attività storica e principale: dai soli sensori di temperatura per vetro e ceramica oggi con varie Business Unit produce una vasta gamma di sensori per tutti i settori (non solo di temperatura),  produce un range completo di strumenti elettronici e sopratutto sviluppa potenti strumenti software. Oltre al settore originale il gruppo è attivo nel settore del processo, lo smartbuilding e controllo accessi, della robotica, nella comunicazione e web, nell’editoria professionale, nel radio-bradcasting, negli investimenti immobiliari e industriali e la storia continua con numerosi progetti in evoluzione.","3346892","Company Hiring Event.

La continua ricerca e la capacità di innovazione hanno portato l’azienda a importanti cambiamenti negli ultimi anni: dal trasferimento della sede in un’area di 11.000 m2 adiacente all’uscita dell’autostrada A1 Modena Nord, alla realizzazione di grandi automazioni secondo i criteri dell’Industria 4.0. Le idee chiave sulle quali sviluppiamo i progetti si basano sul concetto di qualificare e quantificare i processi produttivi per arrivare a una gestione più semplice ed efficiente, studiando soluzioni multifunzionali che consentono di ridurre spazi e risorse e che si integrano totalmente con i sistemi esistenti.  L’elemento fondamentale che permette tutto ciò è lo stesso su cui è basata la nuova forma di Industria 4.0: la comunicazione. Comunicare per creare collaborazione, attraverso le nuove tecnologie di produzione e le infrastrutture informatiche, tra la macchina automatica e ogni elemento dell’azienda, dall’operatore al computer, lavorando in simbiosi con la sua stessa struttura. Rivoluzionandola. Il nostro core business è rappresentato proprio da questo. Non abbiamo un prodotto di serie, ma attraverso studi dedicati e personalizzati realizziamo automazioni su misura per garantire sia una maggior flessibilità e velocità della produzione, sia una migliore qualità del prodotto, rendendolo intrinsecamente più funzionale e quindi più competitivo. Tutto ciò instaurando con il cliente un rapporto non solo di semplice fornitura, ma di vera e propria partnership.","2904663","","","","","","","","","",""

Si offre servizio di prestampa, stampa digitale e incisione di lastre digitali in tempi rapidissimi, e sempre e solo alla massima qualità.  È una delle prime aziende in Italia ad acquistare un CTP (Computer To Plate) passando dalla produzione di pellicole per la stampa offset, alla fornitura di lastre digitali. Negli anni la Print Sprint si è dotata di macchinari sempre più all’avanguardia per la produzione di matrici offset, fino ad arrivare al giorno d’oggi ad avere: 2 CTP Kodak Magnus 800 automatici da 40 lastre/h ciascuno, e un Kodak Magnus VLF automatico. Parallelamente, l’azienda ha investito e creduto nella stampa digitale, Negli anni si sono aggiunte al parco macchine di stampa digitale la Canon OCE VP6160 per il bianco e nero, assieme alla Kodak Nexfinity Ultra, la Canon C10000VP e Konica Minolta 6100 per le stampe a colori.  Un’ulteriore investimento nell’ambito della stampa digitale è la MGI Jet Varnish 3DS, per la nobilitazione degli stampati con vernice spessorata UV e Foil. Nel 2018 viene potenziata la linea di brossura e taglio con l’acquisto di una nuova brossuratrice a quattro ganasce Horizon BQ-470, che ha permesso di aumentare sensibilmente la velocità di produzione di libri e cataloghi. Nel 2019 la Print Sprint fa il suo più importante investimento con l’acquisto di una stampante a bobina a getto d’inchiostro: la Canon Colostream 6000 con inchiostri Chromera. Quest’ultima ha portato un importantissimo passo in avanti per la velocità di stampa di libri e cataloghi, con un’ottima qualità, ed estremamente competitivi sulle tirature da 500 a 2000 copie. Insieme alla ColorStream è stata installata una cucitrice Universe della Meccanotecnica, seguita poi da una seconda nel 2020, che portano l’azienda a consegnare libri e cataloghi filo refe rapidissimi.","2746850","","","","","","","","","",""

Ma allora sorge il dubbio: se i prodotti sono sempre in saldo, allora non lo sono mai veramente. E tutte queste pubblicità su radio, televisione, giornali, qualcuno le dovrà pur pagare. Come sempre, il cliente finale. Il nostro prodotto è totalmente made in Italy (anzi made in Romagna), ed è presente in numerosi mercati esteri.   Da qui la nostra scelta di entrare sul mercato italiano, partendo dalla nostra terra, partendo da Cesena.  Per fare questo, abbiamo deciso di adottare un sistema di vendita chiaro, e che non si prenda gioco dei clienti con finti sconti. Un Factory Store in cui la vendita diretta al pubblico, senza intermediari, insieme al totale controllo della filiera, ci permette di avere sempre uno sconto di almeno il 50% sui prezzi di mercato. Garantito. Di regola chi entra nel nostro negozio deve essere consapevole che la nostra politica dei prezzi sarà sempre chiara e trasparente. Niente fumo negli occhi. Anzi, meglio, niente fumo senza arrosto. In molti si vantano di presentare sul mercato un prodotto artigianale, ma spesso così non è, ed il cliente si trova di fronte a vincoli ben definiti sia a livello di dimensioni, che di tessuti e materiali. Casadar invece offre sempre la possibilità di personalizzare il prodotto con un'amplissima scelta di tessuti e di colori. Quasi sempre possiamo personalizzare anche le misure.  Il divano inizia ad essere realizzato nel momento in cui viene chiuso l'ordine: quindi si tratta di un prodotto unico, realizzato apposta per il cliente. Questo per noi è il significato di vera qualità artigiana. Il nostro obiettivo è quello di portare il modello Casadar in altre zone del paese, e nei principali mercati esteri","1894865","","","","","","","","","",""

Qualche anno dopo, i primi sentori di boom economico, stimolano la famiglia ad aprire un negozio che comincia a portare nelle case vuote di allora i primi elettrodomestici, le prime cucine a gas, i primi apparati radio e televisori e i primi mobili in metallo smaltato.  Poi, negli anni ’80 l’azienda commerciale, ora in mano a due figli della generazione fondatrice, diventa più grande e si sposta nella  nuova sede di 1000 mt 2. Qui, a fianco del collaudato reparto elettrodomestici si da ampio spazio ad un nuovo reparto di mobili per la casa, cucine, soggiorni camere, camerette e complementi.  Nel 2008, non senza difficoltà, viene totalmente rivisto il vecchio edificio, che riapre qualche mese dopo con una veste totalmente nuova, moderna ed efficiente che vanta una superficie di oltre 2000 mt 2  fra spazio dedicato alla  vendita e magazzino. All’interno trovano spazio la nuova ampia superficie dedicata ai mobili con marchi di primaria importanza del made in Italy. Totalmente rinnovato anche lo spazio per gli elettrodomestici, con il quale la Zanetti diventa partner dell’importante gruppo europeo EXPERT, garantendo solidità e prestigio al punto vendita.","1888002","","","","","","","","","",""

Facendo dell’innovazione e ricerca il suo motivo di vita e motore economico.Da sempre identificati come riferimento industriale, nel 1992, grazie alla nostra confidenza con i temi legati alla ripresa fotografica, siamo stati interpellati dalla direzione del parco giochi “Gardaland” , per risolvere in maniera innovativa il tema “Foto Colorado”. Per primi al mondo abbiamo ideato una soluzione elettronica di fotografia nei parchi di divertimento, operazione eccellente visto i risultati diretti ed indiretti, ottenuta anche grazie a processi emotivi calcolati e risultati in pratica vincenti. Nello specifico, ci è stato chiesto di proporre un sistema fotografico in grado di generare un nuovo business. Per questo committente abbiamo allora progettato e realizzato un sistema di ripresa elettronica, grazie al quale veniva stampato un solo frame generato da una telecamera Sony, che riprendeva la discesa del Tronco del Colorado. La genialità non consisteva nel meccanismo innovativo di ripresa elettronica, ma nel fatto che i tempi di percorrenza non consentivano al cliente di vedere nei monitors la propria immagine, ma solo quella degli altri. La propria era già disponibile imbustata e pronta al prezzo di Lire 5.000. Sfruttando quindi l’emotività e un pizzico di opportunismo, abbiamo realizzato allora il business più efficace dell’intera struttura di divertimento. Anche in questo caso il vero valore economico risiedeva nel fattore emotivo, nella diffusione del concetto “Gardaland=piacere”, un valore contaminato dalla diffusione di una immensa quantità di immagini che comunicano questa esperienza.","1759380","","","","","","","","","",""

La scelta di tutti i pezzi unici presentati è il frutto di anni di ricerca, collaborazioni e collezionismo che vengono svelati all’interno della galleria raccontandone le radici. L’opera deve collocarsi davanti allo sguardo dell’osservatore ed esigere il privilegio di un’attenzione destinata a rilevare l’emozione della sua bellezza e ad esaltare il tempo evocatore della sua essenza. Dopo generazioni esperte nell’arte antica e moderna, la famiglia Zanini ha deciso, ormai da anni, di volgere il proprio sguardo anche verso un orizzonte ancora più ampio, quello dell’arte contemporanea. Un’apertura sulla realtà attuale e un dialogo con la società in continuo divenire. Gli artisti rappresentati dalla Galleria Zanini compongono, ciascuno attraverso il proprio linguaggio, un percorso espositivo unico ed eclettico. Pittura, scultura e opere lignee si mescolano tra loro in un dialogo.extra-temporale. LOCATION D’EVENTI Uno dei tre spazi espositivi, oltre a essere incubatore d’arte vuole essere un luogo multifunzionale : l’incipit dei vernissage artistici, la culla delle conferenze letterarie, una sala per presentazioni aziendali ed anche cene private o eventi di beneficenza. La Galleria ZANINI ARTE è un luogo dove poter respirare cultura e convivialità in maniera amicale e professionale. Lo spazio è attrezzato di videoproiettore, tavolo relatori, computer, sedute per gli ospiti e una piccola cucina. Durante la bella stagione, un percorso espositivo en plein air può essere progettato come liason tra i grandi spazi espositivi della galleria.","1711678","","","","","","","","","",""

The solid experience, developed in a territorial area strongly linked to mechanical processing, combined to the passion for sport, in particular for skiing, allows the company to enter a new sector: the vices in aluminum alloy, the historical ski-man bench and the first sanding machines. In fifty years of history, Venini has managed to evolve from a small family company to a structured organization.  The company imposes itself on the national market and establishes itself as a brand. Passion for precision and quality, for clear answers that satisfy all needs. Venini presents itself not only as a supplier, but as a partner in choices and a practical and friendly help.  The company's goal is to follow its customer from the identification of needs, through the design and the restyling of the rental area and laboratories, providing everything necessary: robots and high-tech machines, sanders and ski waxers for the ski-lab, the storage systems for sports equipment, depot lockers for winter equipment, drying solutions and shop furniture for the rental areas. Venini nasce nel 1969 come officina meccanica di precisione. La solida esperienza, sviluppata in un’area territoriale fortemente legata alle lavorazioni meccaniche, collegata alla passione per lo sport, in particolare per lo sci, permette all’azienda di entrare in un nuovo settore: nascono le morse da banco in lega di alluminio, lo storico banchetto da ski man e le prime macchine levigatrici.  Venini in cinquant’anni di storia è riuscita ad evolversi da piccola realtà produttiva famigliare ad un’organizzazione aziendale strutturata. L’azienda si impone sul mercato nazionale e si afferma come brand.  Passione per la precisione ed il mantenimento della qualità, per risposte chiare che soddisfino tutte le esigenze. La Venini si presenta non solo come un fornitore, ma è un partner nelle scelte e un aiuto concreto ed amichevole. L’obiettivo dell’azienda è quello di seguire il proprio cliente dall’individuazione delle esigenze, passando per la progettazione dell’area di noleggio e dei laboratori, fornendo tutto il necessario: i robot e le macchine di alta tecnologia (Venini è la piattaforma logistica e amministrativa di Montana Svizzera Sport International), le levigatrici e sciolinatrici per lo ski-lab, i carelli per le attrezzature sportive, gli armadietti per il deposito degli equipaggiamenti, le soluzioni di asciugatura e i complementi d’arredo per le aree noleggio.","1564593","","","","","","","","","",""

Thanks to an innovative technology and a high rate of automation, it’s possible reduce ink and solvent consumption during the printing process. BFT is born out of the need for innovation on inking systems in the world of flexographic printing. Since most inking systems are manual and free of washing automations, operators must adjust the speed of the pumps and remove the ink bucket manually and insert a bucket of water in the washing phase. For this reason, BFT has created new concept of automatic inking and washing system. Innovative washing and recovery systems that save water and ink and that are emerging as the new industry standard. The modular inking system, so “intelligent” that it can also be used as a control hub – not only for the distribution of the fluid but also for the PH, temperature and other machine board equipment … not to mention 4.0 electronics, which allow the collection and analysis of the data useful for plant management and, aboveall, the consultative relationship with the customer, which starts from the analysis of their plant and their needs to be able to formulate an adequate proposal. “Most inking systems include manual processes, including the pump adjustment and washing. Operations that require prolonged machine downtime and a continuous assistance by the staff. The BFT FLEXO systems are completely automatic: to start any cycle, just press a button on the touch screen. The operator can easily set the speed of the pumps from the screen to optimise the inking phase and the washing phase. Setting is saved and linked to the order to be resumed over time. Saving time and reduce waste of materials.","1516840","Company Hiring Event. Company Bft Flexo announced on 2025-02-17 that they will be hiring Project manager in their  department in Italy.

La connotazione di mercatone, collocato all’interno di strutture moderne ed accoglienti, ci ha permesso di radicare la nostra presenza sul territorio del basso Lazio e nonostante la dimensione ed il carattere ancora di tipo “familiare”, diventare un competitor con cui i Grandi Gruppi nazionali ed internazionali localmente sono chiamati a confrontarsi.  “Signo’ che Le serve?” era l’approccio con cui quarant’anni fa i nostri primi commessi intuivano ed interpretavano i bisogni dei Clienti; oggi attraverso i 360 Collaboratori cerchiamo di metterci a disposizione dei Clienti la professionalità di addetti alle vendite, specializzati ognuno per il settore merceologico che presidia. Oggi Orizzonte è rappresentato da una serie di Punti Vendita di medie e grandi dimensioni - dai 1.000 di Sabaudia a più di 6.000 mq di Terracina - collocati nelle province di Latina, Frosinone e Roma. I vari Punti Vendita vengono alimentati dalla piattaforma Logistica di Borgo S. Donato a Sabaudia, con rifornimenti di merce pressoché quotidiani. Dicono che da noi si trova di tutto, compreso il tempo per divertirsi mentre si fa shopping.","1069852","","","","","","","","","",""

Come tornare in forma dando lo stop a diete rigide e mangiando nel modo giusto? Risponde a questa domanda “Dimagrire Mangiando Metodo Katia Salzano” la ricerca sull’alimentazione che l’esperta Katia Salzano porta avanti da 15 anni, mettendo in primo piano un approccio al cibo sano e soprattutto consapevole, senza rinunce drastiche in cui anche attrezzature tecnologicamente sofisticate fanno la loro parte, come dimostra il sistema brevettato RE-SYSTEM, la nuova tecnologia presentata a Napoli venerdì 4 ottobre a Villa Vittoria. I punti nevralgici del metodo elaborato da Katia Salzano e dal suo team di esperti sono prima di tutto sfatare i falsi miti legati alla nutrizione e al perdere peso. Fondamentale è educare a un’alimentazione corretta, in cui si insegna al paziente a riconoscere i cibi con le loro proprietà benefiche, scoprendo ciò che fa bene al corpo, riparandolo da patologie e alla linea, senza rinunciare al piacere del gusto. “Basta sottoporre a inutili stenti corpo e mente – spiega Katia Salzano - che rendono difficile ottenere il dimagrimento. Infatti sono tanti i preziosi contributi che offriamo ai nostri pazienti, come il ricettario, un vero plus del metodo, che con ricette sane, ma gustose aiuta a rispettare un’alimentazione equilibrata e RE-SYSTEM, il sistema frutto di integrazione e sviluppo delle più avanzate tecnologie del mondo del dimagrimento”. Il reparto di ricerca e sviluppo dell’azienda, attraverso un lavoro costante, è riuscito a brevettare tecnologie capaci di migliorare sia la bellezza esteriore che il benessere interiore. Fulcro fondamentale è la gestione mediante sistemi elettronici che garantiscono l’efficacia e la precisione del sistema. Inoltre i cicli tecnologici appositamente sviluppati e testati beneficiano del costante upgrade basato su criteri di autoapprendimento. Essenziale per Katia Salzano è innanzitutto mettere al centro la persona.","1050016","","","","","","","","","",""

Fondata nel 2015, si tratta dell'unica piattaforma hardware e software appositamente progettata per i club. Il concetto cardine di FLITFIT è la multicanalità: sia sul portale web che nell’app esclusiva, le palestre affiliate hanno la loro pagina dedicata in cui caricare tutti i training della giornata, per fornire un servizio aggiuntivo che sarà molto apprezzato dagli abbonati nel caso in cui siano impossibilitati a recarsi fisicamente in palestra per motivi di lavoro o di vacanza. In questo senso, FLITFIT non vuole sostituire l’esperienza di prossimità fisica dei club, bensì fornire uno strumento in più per fidelizzare la propria clientela. Non solo: FLITFIT dà la possibilità di creare un vero e proprio palinsesto di lezioni, che si rivela utile per due motivi. Da un lato permette infatti agli sportivi di conoscere e provare nuovi tipi di allenamenti, senza dover affrontare la timidezza di seguirli di persona; dall’altro lato consente alle palestre di accrescere la propria popolarità, trasmettendo in tutto il mondo ciò che avviene all’interno delle loro pareti. I club affiliati a FLITFIT ricevono tutto il kit tecnologico necessario per trasmettere le loro lezioni, comprensivo di connettività e device. Non appena pronta, la palestra avrà la sua pagina dedicata sul sito web e sull’app di FLITFIT in cui caricare tutti i propri contenuti. Per gli utenti, invece, FLITFIT funziona sia come archivio storico dei corsi che come strumento per seguire lezioni in diretta. FLITFIT è stato pioniere assoluto nella trasmissione del fitness live e on demand e il sistema è stato già scelto dai club più all’avanguardia d’Italia. Tra i nostri clienti figurano infatti Hard Candy Fitness (Milano), Asterix Club (Bologna), Aquam (Novara), Dabliù (Roma), GClub (Novara), Sport Club 12 (Varese).","1050016","","","","","","","","","",""

The Dooor brand’s collection of folding doors maintains these unique functional features while broadening its aesthetic horizons, thanks to new printing techniques and the use of high-tech cladding materials. The result is an architectural element with a minimalist look that connects spaces seamlessly, but which is also decorative and capable of adding a distinctive and highly individual touch to the rooms in which they are used.

The experience and business acumen of three generations of the family have led to the creation of a range of innovative cooking utensils for catering professionals and lovers of responsible, healthy cooking with an open-minded approach to the future but feet planted in tradition. The Ghisanativa® range of cookware is made of extremely pure cast iron. Every product is made entirely by Fonderia Finco at the company’s foundry near Padua in northern Italy. The key virtue of Ghisanativa® cast iron is the exceptional purity, because the non-stick surface is not reached by using complex of hazardous chemical compounds but by an exclusively physical treatment based on one of the healthiest and most typically Italian of foods: extra virgin olive oil. The “raw” cast iron pieces once cooled are heated again to very high temperatures in static oven. The intense heat causes an ultra-hard layer of magnetite which protects it from the rust. In the next step, a film of extra virgin olive oil is applied by hand to the surface. Further heating to 400°C then polymerises the olive oil in the magnetite to create a black, satin smooth to the touch, extremely resistant to high temperature and most importantly, with a natural non-stick finish. Fonderia Finco launched in the market a generation of new portable cast iron stove0s: ELIOS. Conceived for the professional kitchen, the catering world and lovers of excellent cuisine an essential business tool. The exclusive design gives it a strong impact, ideal for show-cooking events or any outside parties (pool party, garden party etc.). ELIOS is available in different models, LPG/town gas (PLUS and WOK for Asian cooking) or ELIOS INFRARED. We compete our range with SOTHIS: the first professional cooking-cart, designed to last. It is the perfect tool for cooking-shows, flambé cooking, catering and it is conceived for a safe use in theaters and TV studios.","1017138","","","","","","","","","",""

Il grande punto forza della MCS Srl è, dunque, l’alto contenuto tecnologico della proposta offerta ai clienti, tanto sul panorama nazionale quanto su quello internazionale.  Il laboratorio metrologico interno, a disposizione dei clienti, permette alla MCS Srl di assicurare la conformità dei dispositivi di misura alle norme internazionali, nel pieno rispetto dei requisiti metrologici richiesti delle disposizioni ISO 9001, ISO 14001 e ISO 45001 (OHSAS 18001). Il servizio nasce per garantire un notevole risparmio di tempo nelle lunghe e complesse ricerche, oltre a semplificare tutti gli sforzi collegati all'introduzione di apparecchiature di nuova acquisizione ed al controllo dei dispositivi di misura già in dotazione. MCS Srl è anche un laboratorio riconosciuto da ACCREDIA, quale Laboratorio Accreditato di Taratura. Il noto ente di accreditamento italiano ha attestato la competenza tecnica dell’azienda nell’effettuazione di tarature, considerate attendibili grazie alle procedure seguite dai professionisti, capaci di assicurare la conformità alle norme internazionali e la riferibilità ai campioni metrologici nazionali ed internazionali.","959465","","","","","","","","","",""

Dai primi anni ’80 abbandona il settore degli elettrodomestici per dedicarsi all’alta fedeltà e al video, divenendo in breve un punto di riferimento per gli audiofili di Torino e non solo. In parallelo iniziano le attività di installazione di laboratori linguistici, di sonorizzazione di sale riunioni ed audio/video (come si chiamavano allora). All’inizio degli anni ’90 è uno dei primi negozi di Torino a presentare le innovative tecnologie video “a schermo piatto”, proponendo ai propri clienti privati e aziendali sistemi audio/video basati esclusivamente schermi LCD ed al Plasma. In parallelo amplia la propria offerta con sistemi home theater e multiroom, che aumentano l’impatto sensoriale e la fruibilità degli impianti, permettendo di realizzare veri ambienti multimediali, nelle case come nelle aziende, a partire da un unico impianto. È ora nuovamente rivolta al futuro, con l’apertura di una nuova linea di offerta di sistemi di domotica (home automation), per permettere ai clienti di integrare gli impianti multimediali con quelli di casa e semplificarne così la gestione complessiva.

Si svolge a Torino, ad inizio settembre, dal 2009 ed è un’iniziativa dell’Associazione Culturale Verve, iscritta al Tavolo dell’Associazionismo Giovanile Torinese. L’Associazione opera prevalentemente nell’ambito della promozione dei giovani talenti e all’organizzazione di iniziative di carattere culturale e artistico sul territorio piemontese. La creazione di un circuito legato alla musica e agli artisti emergenti può essere stimolo e creare opportunità di crescita e sviluppo per i giovani artisti e per tutte le realtà che operano in questo settore. Offrendo la competenza ed esperienza guadagnata sul campo Verve mette in contatto artisti, istituzioni, aziende e cittadini con l’obiettivo di migliorare lo scambio e rafforzare il potenziale creativo che contraddistingue il nostro territorio. A questo scopo Verve ha riunito gli artisti emergenti del panorama indipendente torinese in un’unica realtà, offrendo ad essi gli strumenti e la visibilità necessari per la divulgazione dei propri progetti. Nel 2009 con la prima edizione del _resetfestival, è stato dimostrato che la musica inedita di qualità riempie nuovamente i locali e le piazze, appassiona e stimola il pubblico e, grazie alla collaborazione delle istituzioni e dei privati è auto sostenibile. Il Festival coinvolge ogni anno tra le 30 e le 50 formazioni, provenienti in gran parte dal nord Italia, ma non solo. Oltre cento musicisti di diversa estrazione ed esperienza: ma non si tratta di dilettanti; spesso infatti vengono presentati progetti nuovi di musicisti professionisti o già affermati. Nellʼarco di due giorni, Piazza Vittorio Veneto, ospita diversi stage per accogliere al meglio tutte le forme di performance: jazz, classica, rock, elettronica, cantautorale, in set acustico o elettrico, in solo, duo o band.","951092","","","","","","","","","",""

In sinergia con le migliori aziende del settore siamo sempre in grado di risolvere spazi abitativi e lavorativi diversi: uffici, negozi, residence, rendendoli accoglienti e funzionali, ma anche spazi esterni quali giardini, terrazzi e pergolati con i complementi più adeguati.  La cura del montaggio e del post-vendita costituisce una priorità fondamentale del nostro personale specializzato: nulla è lasciato al caso. La nostra decennale esperienza ci consente di suggerire la soluzione più adatta nel caso di ""semplice"" restyling dell'ambiente cucina, o nella sostituzione dei vecchi elettrodomestici da incasso ( frigoriferi, piani cottura, forni, lavastoviglie...) con interventi di falegnameria dove necessario. Il nostro spirito di squadra ci ha permesso, con soddisfazione, di realizzare ""emozioni"" oltre confine (Costa Azzurra, Svizzera, Belgio, Spagna, Inghilterra...) portandoci dietro il gusto del Made in Italy.  Nella casa di vacanza, mare o montagna, il comfort è protagonista: la scelta dell'arredo è l'espressione delle esigenze abitative del cliente, i piccoli spazi vengono studiati e risolti al meglio, cosicché il termine ""seconda casa"" diventi superfluo.","947432","","","","","","","","","",""

Uno dei nostri punti di forza è di saper coniugare tradizione con innovazione e di far convivere più linguaggi, analogici e digitali, quali la fotografia, la pittura, il video, la musica, la scrittura. Eosliber è nato osservando le app per la pittura digitale che imitano, attraverso pennelli e colori digitali, l’antica tecnica della pittura a olio, che ci hanno fatto sviluppare la seguente riflessione: se oggi le diverse tecniche artistiche tradizionali stanno convergendo in un unica piattaforma digitale (il tablet, pc, telefono) nel prossimo futuro si potrà parlare di un nuovo linguaggio che ingloba tecniche che fino ad oggi sono state considerate come separate, pittura, fotografia, video, musica, calligrafia, disegno, scultura… Utilizzando diversi software gli artisti che si servono di questi strumenti digitali stanno anticipando una possibile nuova forma di comunicazione che lavora su più dimensioni, di cui i GIF animati, i boomerang, o altri formati similari, sarebbero solo un piccolo assaggio.

Nasce con l’obiettivo di fornire servizi tipolitografici alle molteplici aziende del Mobile che popolano l’area dell’Alta Brianza. L’evoluzione continua della tecnologia nel ramo printing, ha permesso di racchiudere in un’unica Azienda anche la tampografia e la stampa serigrafica. Con l’avvento della stampa digitale, all’inizio degli Anni 2000, si è resa necessaria una diversificazione del core business: da un lato, mantenendo l’identità aziendale, con l’aggiunta di stampanti a grande formato e plotter per la realizzazione di striscioni e prespaziati; dall’altro mediante l’introduzione di macchine per il taglio e marcatura laser di precisione e frese con centri di lavoro a controllo numerico. Con tale evoluzione, Centro Stampa Elleci è diventata un’azienda fornitrice di servizi avanzati, permettendo così una ottimizzazione sia a livello tecnico/organizzativo, che in termini di qualità/costi per il Cliente. Oggi come nel 1979, gli obiettivi primari di Centro Stampa Elleci sono la soddisfazione e la fidelizzazione del Cliente, ottenuti grazie agli alti standard qualitativi ed alla continua evoluzione tecnica e pratica delle risorse umane all’interno dell’Azienda, che fanno sentire il Cliente in “mani sicure”, con la certezza della perfetta e tempestiva realizzazione del prodotto richiesto. ------------------------------ Centro Stampa Elleci was founded in Meda, Lombardy, in 1979. The mission was to provide printing services to the Brianza Furniture District. The continue development of printing technology allowed the company to take over also silk-screen printing and other printing-type devices. At the begininning of '00, the core business changed into two different types of services: PMMA working, with the production of exhibiting display, and large size printing, for banners and visual communication. Today, as in 1979, our goals are customer satisfaction and timeliness in work.","863049","","","","","","","","","",""

A questi servizi sono state successivamente affiancate altre lavorazioni: stampa digitale, preparazione di lastre e pellicole per la stampa offset e stampa offset, preparazione di pellicole per la stampa serigrafica e stampa serigrafica, stampa a caldo, a rilievo e a secco, microincisione al laser, vernici UV, ricami, e ogni altro tipo di finitura; fustellatura, rilegature di qualsiasi tipo e confezioni uniche capaci di esprimere personalità.  In ultimo MGP è stata pioniere nell’utilizzo dell’innovativa tecnologia di stampa Flatbed, un sistema di stampa assolutamente unico, destinato sia alle applicazioni da esterno che da interno, caratterizzato dalla grande flessibilità d’utilizzo. Questo perché MGP ha da sempre la ferma volontà di accompagnare e consigliare ogni cliente, allo scopo di assicurare la soluzione più adatta a raggiungere i risultati visivi e tattili inseguiti e voluti. Per MGP ogni idea diventa un nuovo progetto, una sfida per provare e sperimentare continuamente tecniche, finiture e possibilità di stampa nuove. Un’occasione unica per esprimere tutto il proprio potenziale e il proprio carattere. Un carattere speciale.","838121","","","","","","","","","",""

Dato che non esisteva un posto simile in Italia lo abbiamo creato noi. E’ nato così il marchio Fun Factory h24. Abbiamo la presunzione di dire che stiamo vincendo la nostra battaglia nel demolire quei muri di ipocrisia e falso moralismo sempre così presenti in Italia. Visti con scetticismo all’inizio, abbiamo convinto la gente che i nostri sono negozi dove puoi venire con il tuo partner, con gli amici oppure solo e nessuno penserà male di te. Questo perché abbiamo creato negozi automatici tremendamente belli, eleganti, divertenti e con un macchinario che non ha eguali sul mercato perché ti permette di leggere le descrizioni dei prodotti, le note, i materiali, così come se ti trovassi al pc davanti a un sito web. Le testimonianze che ci lasciano i nostri clienti, i complimenti che ci fanno quando ci incontrano e le recensioni che parlano bene di noi sono il più bel premio che potevamo ricevere per aver creduto al nostro sogno. Sono il miglior biglietto da visita nei tuoi confronti.","629334","","","","","","","","","",""

Research then led to focus on the experimentation of materials and their reactions by using a technology which had been on the market for years, yet which was never really exploited until then. All these activities took place in a small lab on the hills of Florence, with no specific equipment nor such specific technologies to support such an important project, yet with great persistence and an even greater desire to make something unique. Then the company focused on applying research by capitalizing on the concrete and active experience in electronics and electro mechanics of another partner who provided materials, tests and any other technical specifications which was necessary to turn it into a technology, previously considered as “uninteresting” in the sound scenario, which made Glauk become what it is today on both a national and international scenario. Also the operational headquarters moved from to the hills around Florence to a small office in the city where electronics, sound engineering and new market demands were dealt with daily.","544012","","","","","","","","","",""

Negli ultimi anni la dipendenza dai dispositivi digitali come smartphone, tablet, computer ha rivoluzionato le nostre abitudini di vita, sociali e lavorative. Siamo sempre connessi, sempre impegnati a comunicare o a cercare informazioni. E mentre navighiamo nei nostri dispositivi, veniamo subissati di notifiche, continuamente. 9 Seconds si inserisce per risolvere questa situazione: essa nasce per aprire le porte del “Benessere Digitale”. Per disinnescare gli effetti più critici della tecnologia e sfruttare, allo stesso tempo, le potenzialità che la stessa tecnologia ci mette a disposizione. Il progetto è portato avanti da sette ragazzi salentini, con l’obiettivo di migliorare il rapporto con il nostro smartphone.  “9 Seconds” vuole dunque combattere la dipendenza da smartphone e tutto ciò che ne deriva. E lo fa attraverso un gioco basato su un meccanismo di “rinuncia-ricompensa”in grado di premiare i giocatori per il tempo passato senza il proprio cellulare. Permettendo all’utente di mettere da parte lo smartphone in circostanze meno opportune che richiedono concentrazione, come nei momenti di studio, di lavoro e sociali. L’app vuole contrastare la dipendenza da smartphone, incidere sull’aumento della concentrazione ed incoraggiare la socializzazione dell’utente. Inglobando,nello stesso meccanismo, alcune aziende partners che beneficiano dell’app per pubblicizzarsi e fidelizzare con il cliente.  Il viaggio è appena iniziato. Un viaggio che siamo sicuri ci porterà verso un mondo con più sorrisi e meno emoticon.","475546","","","","","","","","","",""

SHOUTER nasce sulla base di queste esigenze: il servizio offre la possibilità di interazione nella scelta della musica in un’attività commerciale da parte sia dei clienti, attraverso un’applicazione mobile, che del gestore, installando un software per pc. Una rivisitazione in chiave social e digitale di un’apparecchiatura per fare musica, divenuta simbolo di molte generazioni: il jukebox.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- How many times have you experienced during a night out, on your favorite place, to find yourself thinking, “wouldn’t be nice, while you enjoy your favorite drink, to pick your background music?” Also, think about the fact that any owner is frequently undecided when it comes to pick what type of music play on their place.  “ Do i leave the radio on? or Do i play a CD risking to limit the atmosphere of the business ?” It’s a waste of time just thinking about it. SHOUTER was created to overcome this matter: This service offers the possibility of choice and interaction with the music in any business, simply, by using a mobile application as client, and installing a pc software, as an owner.

Per la passione che ci contraddistingue da sempre, abbiamo realizzato un processo tutto nuovo per personalizzare i dispositivi mediante 2 tipologie di stampa; uno tampografico per riportare piccoli loghi monocromatici, uno rotativo, per realizzare grafiche più complesse, fino a stampare tutta la superfice esterna.","360631","","","","","","","","","",""

La progettazione meccanica ed elettronica viene eseguita internamente all’azienda, da tecnici che hanno maturato la loro esperienza principalmente nel settore della trasformazione della carta. La progettazione condotta internamente e l’attitudine a fornire soluzioni altamente performanti garantiscono inoltre quella flessibilità spesso richiesta da un cliente sempre più alla ricerca di personalizzazioni in grado di soddisfare ogni sua esigenza. Riteniamo che conoscere le reali necessità del cliente sia il punto di partenza ottimale per raggiungere con successo gli obiettivi preposti.  TISSUE CONVERTING MACHINE Since its inception in 2002, Tissuewell has consistently pursued the objectives of continuous innovation, product quality and systematic investments in the quest for new, increasingly high performing solutions.

The machines are mechanically and electronically designed in-house by technicians who have matured their experience mainly in the field of paper converting. Machines designed in-house and the capability to supply high performance solutions further guarantee that flexibility often requested by customers who are increasingly looking for personalization that can satisfy every demand.
