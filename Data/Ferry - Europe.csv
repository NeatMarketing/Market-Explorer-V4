Struktura floty Unity Line umożliwia obsługę wszystkich grup odbiorców: pasażerów, spedytorów oraz przewoźników drogowych i kolejowych.

Rosnące zainteresowanie usługami Unity Line oraz stały rozwój oferty w bezpośredni sposób przekładają się na kolejne inwestycje podejmowane przez Spółkę. We wrześniu 2008 roku, do ruchu wprowadzona została kolejna jednostka pasażerska – m/f Skania. Dzięki temu promy pasażerskie Unity Line pokonują trasę Świnoujście – Ystad w ruchu wahadłowym. Oznacza to, że pasażerowie w jeszcze bardziej elastyczny i komfortowy sposób mogą planować swoją podróż.

The Danish port is the northernmost port on the European Westcoast, and many Norwegians refer to it as ‘the southernmost port in Norway’.  The Port of Hirtshals’ geographical position is a competitive strength. With the port’s location, directly to the North Sea, and only a short distance to one of the world’s busiest sea lanes, the possibilities of developing transport solutions are numerous.  The Port of Hirtshals has more than 60 ferries and ro/ro calls per week, and the port has services to five destinations in Norway, and services to the Faroe Island, Iceland, Russia, and Scotland: •	Bergen, Norway  •	Stavanger, Norway  •	Kristiansand, Norway  •	Langesund, Norway  •	Larvik, Norway  •	Torshavn, Faroe Islands  •	Seydisfjordur, Iceland  •	Reykjavik (Thorlakshöfn), Iceland •	Scrabster, Scotland The Port of Hirtshals is directly connected to the European motorway network. Motorway E39/E45 takes its starting point at the Port of Hirtshals, and continues to the German border and from there to the rest of Europe.  In 2015, a new combi terminal for rail traffic was established next to the port. Scheduled rail traffic has not yet been established, but more leading European rail operators are planning to start-up of traffic between Hirtshals and logistics centres in Europe.  In 2019, more than 150,000 trucks and trailers passed through the Port of Hirtshals, and approximately 20 % of these were craneable. The number of units and the increasing cargo traffic at the Port of Hirtshals underlines the potential for rail traffic between Hirtshals and Europe.  To obtain the benefits of combined transport in the transport sector, cooperation from all parties is essential.","20138688","Company Hiring Event.

The ferry transport division was transferred into the hands of the Dutch management team through a management buy-out. Today Mammoet Ferry Transport BV operates with a staff of 80 highly motivated employees. Using a modern fleet of 400 trailers operating from seven subsidiaries, the company is confidently handling 30000 shipments annually.

Aegean Speed Lines was the first Greek company to employ a European Union flag vessel in the Greek cabotage, SPEEDRUNNER I, in the scope of deregulation of ferry services in our country. In 2006, Aegean Speed Lines changed its shareholders synthesis following the divestment of Sea Containers while the Eugenides Group of Companies maintained its significant share holding. This new scheme resulted from the synergy of well respected investors who consider Greek coastal shipping as a sector of the Greek Economy with high prospects. This new alliance provided Aegean Speed Lines with enhanced dynamics, feature at the needs of the modern passenger and the development of the islands. In the same respect, Aegean Speed Lines covers the transportation needs of the western Cycladic islands, because the company strongly believes that by offering a multitude of transportation solutions is catalytic to the growth and prosperity of all residents of the region. Staff of Aegean Speed Lines think and act as passengers themselves, so as to predict plans and offer on a daily basis, high standard services. Since 2009 till 2011, except the routes of Piraeus-Western Cyclades (Serifos, Sifnos, Milos, Kimolos, Folegandros), the fleet of Aegean Speed Lines served the Piraeus-Syros-Tinos-Mykonos, Piraeus-Thira-Ios - Sikinos and Piraeus-Paros-Naxos routes. In order to serve these schedules Aegean Speed Lines used three ultra-modern high-speed vessels: SPEEDRUNNER II, SPEEDRUNNER III, and SPEEDRUNNER IV which meet leading comfort, quality and safety requirements.  Just 5 years from its inception in December 2009, the company was granted the honours by Lloyds List, characterized as "" The best shipping company of the year "", for its commitment and dedication to providing high quality services. Aegean Speed Lines has limited the schedule since 2015, attending to West Cyclades with SPEEDRUNNER III, which executes schedules to Piraeus - Serifos – Sifnos – Milos - Kimolos - Folegandros - Sikinos.","6293340","","","","","","","","","",""
