Our story starts in 1818 when Thomas Heiton set up business in Dublin as a coal importer and distributor meeting the needs of the growing city. In the early 1900s the business diversified, adding a sector specialising in iron products, and from the 1960s onwards, additional products such as timber and plumbing products were added. Our Chadwicks business was founded in 1902 by William Thomas Chadwick at Talbot Place, Dublin, to supply builders' merchants and the major building contractors with cement and plaster produced in Ireland and abroad. During this time all deliveries to Chadwicks' customers throughout Dublin City and County were by horse drawn vehicles. In the early days the firm owned three horses and carts, but as business increased they added a fourth horse and cart and employed another driver! In the '50s the business expaned, moving to bigger premises in Walkinstown and adding new lines such as fire clay to its range of building products. Further expansion took place in the '60s and in 1967 the company opened its first branch outside Dublin, in Kilkenny. Today, Chadwicks is Ireland's leading Builders Merchants and Home Improvement Specialist, offering customers a huge range of timber, building materials and home improvement supplies including plumbing and heating products. Chadwicks Group currently operates Chadwicks, Heiton Steel, The Panelling Centre, Telfords, Cork Builders Providers, Proline, Sitetech, Morgans Timber, HSS Hire Ireland and Davies builders' and plumbers' merchanting businesses in the Republic of Ireland.","274607334","","","","","","","","","",""

Both Øyvind and Terje have long and successful track records as innovators and entrepreneurs. The Viking Arm tool is their first product made for both the professional craftsman and home improvement enthusiast.  “If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right”, says a Norwegian proverb. We took this to heart when developing the Viking Arm. Every single detail in the manufacturing process, from the stainless steel parts, aluminum body to the springs that control the lever, has been tested and verified. And then tested and verified again. The result? A completely new tool with specifications and quality that exceed the demands of professionals, yet affordable for handicraft enthusiasts everywhere.  Today, the Viking Arm is rapidly gaining ground in both domestic and international markets. But this is only the beginning.  The Viking Arm is the first of a planned product range of patented precision hand tools, all built with our ingenious combination of innovation and high build quality.  Our business strategy is to stay focused on the path that cultivates our passion for innovation, keeps our product desirable and appreciated and strengthens and differentiates the Viking Arm brand qualities – innovative and lasting design, superior craftsmanship, creativity and an intimate understanding of the professional craftsman’s needs. The company’s Vision is that Viking Arm shall be recognized for its innovation, quality and speed to market. This clearly forms our Mission: “Viking Arm shall develop and deliver radically innovative new tools in the global market’’.  It’s as simple as that.   Viking Arm AS is located in Oslo with a manufacturing facility in Bærum (Greater Oslo).

The company further expanded its business, opening a showroom in Paphos. A subsidiary company in Larnaca was also established in 2002. The same year there was a division of operations and PK Trading House Ltd was founded, distributing DIY items and offering a wide range of plastic storage solutions, such as plastic sheds, cabinets and cushion boxes. In the following years the company has enhanced its product range, particularly decorative materials, and grew significantly, forming collaborations with big international companies. Most notably with Hafele in 2017 and Corian in 2018, becoming the exclusive distributor in Cyprus for both brands. In 2019, we opened the first Hafele Partner Shop in Cyprus, in our showroom in Limassol.

Now the term ‘man of the house’ is thankfully fading into obscurity and women control 80% of global consumer spending (90% in home improvements). But yet the industry is still wildly underserving its majority market. There’s no scarcity of work, but there is a huge deficit of skilled craftspeople. That’s why it takes 6 weeks for a handyman to come to your house, say he doesn’t have the right tools, charge you 100€ and leave. Unsurprisingly, when employment opportunities are only accessible to half the population - standards fall. As customers, we’ve universally accepted such poor standards that if we’re not scammed or sexually harassed, then we consider this an awesome service. In an industry where you’re not just in someone’s home, you’re in their bathroom, in their bedroom, you’re moving their things around and using loud tools - trust, communication, accountability and safety should be at the forefront. Driller Queens solves both of these problems with one platform. We provide underemployed, skilled FLINTA* craftspeople with well-paid flexible work, Creating a workforce that actually understands and serves the needs of our customers. The bar in the Handyman industry is so low it’s practically a trip hazard. And we’re going to raise it. Want to know more?
