A true desire to found a business culture that was different from the ones we know was born. Classic businesses recruit challenge-oriented people but end up destroying their potential by locking them up in structures and processes. The result is a total absence of creation and innovation. Creating a stimulating environment where you can grow, develop and break the rules is our main objective. ViaXoft has 3 offices in Marseille, Paris and Montpellier.

La société travaille pour de nombreux magazines (Sport Auto, Psychologies Magazine, Voile et voiliers, etc.), des hebdomadaires non moins renommés (Auto Plus, Moto Journal, la Gazette de Drouot, etc.), ainsi que les plus grands voyagistes (Club Med, Jet Tours, Kuoni, etc.) pour lesquels elle réalise de nombreux catalogues. En outre, elle œuvre pour des sociétés d’édition : Francis Lefèvre, Hachette pour lequel la société réalise son Dictionnaire Encyclopédique, ou encore, les éditions Textuel et 44ème parallèle. De quoi réaliser de gros volumes en production puisque, selon la période de l’année, l’entreprise produit entre 6000 et 12000 pages par mois… Compos Juliot est l’une des dix filiales du Groupe SEGO, grand groupe français qui maîtrise l’intégralité de la chaîne graphique professionnelle, du pré-presse au post-presse en passant par l’impression proprement dite. Parmi toutes les fonctions qu’elle couvre il en est une qui revêt une importance toute particulière : la sécurisation des fichiers Tiff/IT et PDF qui transitent par la société. En effet, aujourd’hui, moins de 1% de la production de Compos Juliot est encore réalisée « à l’ancienne » à partir de films. Le reste des documents traités répond aux spécifications des formats PDF (jusqu’à 80% des documents traités) et Tiff/IT.","16326752","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by an intimate knowledge of and affection for French Polynesia (also called the islands of Tahiti), Discover Polynesia invites you to the ultimate travel experience, devoid of gimmicks and blissfully released from mass tourism. With its expertise of Travel Designer, exclusive deals and extensive travel experience, Discover Polynesia is able to design tailored itineraries to fulfill each travel dream. The advantages of delegating to a Travel Designer are multiple: Tahiti is a remote and vast destination that spans on a territory as vast as Europe (a total of 118 islands), so it is almost impossible to coordinate your trip by yourself, contrary to other destinations. Discover Polynesia imagine a realistic and relevant program regarding the profile of travellers (solo, couples, families).  Due to its complexities, the destination of Tahiti and its islands is an ""intermediated"" destination, in other words with many intermediaries (in the traditional distribution: you book through your preferred travel agency based in your living area > that buys your stay trough a specialized tour operator based in your country > that buys your stay to an inbound travel agency based in Tahiti...). Of course, each intermediary margins the production of your stay. Discover Polynesia allows to reduce the costs of your stay, by removing an intermediary, connecting you directly with the most relevant inbound travel agency.","8236000","","","","","","","","","",""

Depuis sa création, l’association a développé et conduit : - le centre de loisirs associé à l’école élémentaire de Lardenne, - le centre de loisirs associé à l’école élémentaire d’Emilie-de-Rodat, - le centre de loisirs sans hébergement. Le succès croissant des actions et de l’implantation de l’association dans le paysage social du quartier va naturellement l’amener à élargir ses actions en direction des familles et des habitants de Lardenne. Progressivement, une complémentarité et une cohérence éducative voient le jour et permettent la mise en place d’ateliers, l’organisation d’événements collectifs. En 2013, afin d’être mieux identifiée, l’amicale devient l’Animation Sociale et Solidaire des Quartiers Ouest Toulousains. Aujourd’hui, l’ASSQOT est devenue un acteur majeur dans l’animation socio-éducative du secteur Ouest de Toulouse. Elle s’articule de la manière suivante : - le CLAE à l’école élémentaire de Lardenne, - le CLAE à l’école élémentaire Emilie de Rodat, - le Centre de Loisirs pour les enfants de 6 à 17 ans basé à Lardenne, - l’accueil jeunes qui regroupe des collégiens et lycéens du territoire d’intervention, - le Centre Social Polygone, - le Centre Social Bagatelle, - le jardin partagé « les coccinelles » à Bagatelle, - 4 CLAS (Contrat Local d’Accompagnement à la Scolarité) dans les quartiers de Polygone, Cépière-Beauregard, Arènes et Bagatelle, - des séjours vacances, - des stages sportifs  et culturels en partenariat avec les acteurs du territoire, - un Club d’Astronomie qui organise des événements grand public et des sorties en région, - 3 ateliers adultes à Lardenne : Badminton, Basket et Yoga, - des événements en partenariat avec les acteurs du territoire.","8144526","Company Hiring Event.

L'expérience glanée lors de leurs expéditions aux quatre coins du monde fournit la matière d'un premier ouvrage : le Guide du Jeune Voyageur, ou comment voyager “malin” et sans se ruiner. De nombreux autres ouvrages suivront, avec toujours pour thème fédérateur le voyage : guides Let's Go, guides Balades nature, guides Que Faire en France ? Aujourd'hui, les éditions Dakota sont toujours dirigées par leurs trois fondateurs.

Il réalise une demande de séjour en précisant un certain nombre de critères sur les modalités du voyage qu'il souhaite mettre en place : activité, périodes, hébergement, typologie des co-voyageurs recherchés ? Cette demande est ensuite directement transmise au voyagiste concerné qui peut alors établir une proposition finalisée et chiffrée. À l'acceptation par l'internaute de la proposition (et paiement d'un acompte), le séjour est validé puis publié sur le site. Ce membre devient l'initiateur de ce voyage. Les Membres du site peuvent alors commencer à s'inscrire au voyage inititié : leur inscription définitive étant soumise à validation de l'initiateur du voyage et au paiement par l'internaute d'un acompte. > L'internaute souhaite participer à un voyage déjà initié par un membre : Après inscription, il consulte les séjours des membres et/ou des coachs. Il peut alors ""postuler"" pour participer à un séjour initié en réalisant une demande auprès de l'initiateur du voyage en précisant quelques points sur soi et sa motivation. L'initiateur du voyage reçoit alors le formulaire avec les éléments du co-voyageur intéressé. Deux possibilités : accepter ou non la participation de ce membre. Si sa requête est validée, la demande de participation du co-voyageur avec ses précisions est transmise auprès du voyagiste, un devis personnalisé est transmis au co-voyageur. A l'acceptation de cette proposition et paiement d'un acompte, la participation du membre est publiée.","3731000","","","","","","","","","",""

Pour cela, deux impératifs : 1. un coût abordable, 2. aucun risque lié à la vitesse.  Dès 1987, Jean-Jacques Rey, fondateur de Désertours, crée son tout premier événement sportif, le Biarritz-Dakak, un rêve devenu réalité durant lequel il met son expérience et sa fougue au service d’autres voyageurs à l’âme aventurière.  Au fil du temps, Désertours devient le tour opérateur leader du raid-aventure sur mesure. Les rallyes et séminaires se déploient aux quatre coins du monde, hors compétition de vitesse, en 4×4, moto, quad, SSV ou VTT.  Jean-Jacques Rey s’éloigne progressivement et régulièrement de son Pays basque natal pour faire découvrir le Maghreb, le Sénégal, le Namibie, l’Okavango, le Botswana, le Zimbabwe, l’Egypte, la Lybie et même la Thaïlande. Outre-Atlantique, il arpente aussi l’Ouest des Etats-Unis, le Mexique ou encore le Venezuela en créant des séjours à la carte pour ses clients amateurs de sports automobiles. Désertours, organisateur d’événements sportifs et solidaires accessibles à tous À la veille de l’an 2000, Désertours se mue peu à peu en organisateur d’événements sportifs et solidaires dédiés aux jeunes et aux femmes en quête de ce type d’expéditions. Un public que l’on n’a pas l’habitude de croiser sur les pistes désertiques… Qu’à cela ne tienne ! Jean-Jacques Rey commence par adapter le concept du rallye auto-moto afin de le rendre accessible à tous et à toutes.

Dix studios, une résidence, et déjà une conviction forte : allier performance et transparence pour les propriétaires. L’entreprise grandit vite, portée par un modèle innovant fondé sur la maîtrise des tarifs, la saisonnalité et un suivi rigoureux des revenus. En 2019, un VRMS et une stratégie de Yield Management boostent la rentabilité. En 2020, la marque Sol-y-Days – Vos vacances en Camargue ouvre la voie à une approche plus touristique, inspirée du modèle des agences de voyage. En 2022, l’arrivée de Yann des Abbayes accélère la digitalisation : CRM, SEO, multi-diffusion, tarification dynamique… Résultat : +50 % de performance à parc constant entre 2023 et 2025, et une part de réservations directes passée de 15 % à plus de 30 %. En 2024, le développement s’étend à La Grande-Motte, avec la reprise d’Home Office Immobilier. Sous la direction de Céline Loubet, l’activité transaction se structure, tandis qu’Arthémis devient Cooper Immobilier Grau-du-Roi. Les deux agences sont désormais réunies sous une même identité, pilotées par la holding SOLYDAYS, également détentrice de la marque touristique. Aujourd’hui, Cooper Immobilier & Sol-y-Days, c’est : 95 logements sous mandat, 924 000 € de loyers encaissés, un chiffre d’affaires consolidé de 678 800 € HT en 2025, et une rentabilité en nette progression. 📈 Notre ambition 2026 : renforcer notre présence locale, investir dans un nouveau siège au Grau-du-Roi et poursuivre la croissance du parc. Nous recherchons aujourd’hui des investisseurs spécialisés dans l’immobilier et le tourisme, pour accompagner cette nouvelle phase d’expansion.

Fondée en 1980 pour accompagner la naissance du musée, elle réunit des amateurs d’art passionnés par la seconde moitié du XIXème et du début du XXème siècle.  Association régie par la loi 1901, elle est reconnue d’Utilité Publique depuis le 6 décembre 2007 et devient la Société des Amis des musées d'Orsay et de l'Orangerie en 2013.  Ses membres, environ 600 aujourd’hui, ont permis l’acquisition de plus de 600 œuvres pour une valeur globale de 2 600 000 €. Par son intermédiaire, environ 800 œuvres et ensembles d’objets d’arts sont entrés dans les collections des deux musées sous forme de dons ou d'acquisitions.  En devenant mécènes, les membres participent donc activement au développement d’un lieu de culture exceptionnel et participent également de manière privilégiée à la vie des deux musées. Par l'adhésion ou le soutien ponctuel à la Société des Amis des musées d’Orsay et de l'Orangerie, ses membres deviennent des mécènes à titre particulier et de véritables ambassadeurs du musée : au travers de l’enrichissement des collections, des voyages et visites organisés, les membres de la SAMO participent à son dynamisme ainsi qu’à son rayonnement en France et à l’étranger. Pour découvrir en images quelques-unes des acquisition effectuées depuis 1980, des exemples de visites et voyages organisés ces dernières années, les personnalités constituant son conseil d'administration et celles constituant l'équipe des amis d'Orsay et de l'Orangerie, rendez-vous sur notre site internet : www.amis-musee-orsay.org.

La finalité et les buts sont identiques : promouvoir en France toutes les destinations d’Amérique Latine. Notre site internet Cotal.fr est à la disposition des adhérents. Il vient compléter de manière permanente nos actions : réunions, déjeuners à thèmes, workshops, newsletters et toutes les manifestations que nous organisons pour la promotion d’évènements spécifiques, en collaboration avec les Ambassades, les Offices de Tourisme, les Compagnies Aériennes et les Voyagistes, selon les opportunités. L’ensemble des professionnels concernés par l’Amérique Latine, Voyagistes, Croisiéristes, Agences, Compagnies Aériennes, Hôteliers, Réceptifs, Presse – sont cordialement invités à nous rejoindre pour donner ainsi à tous la possibilité de se rencontrer et de travailler avec les spécialistes de chacune des destinations d’Amérique Latine. Et l’objectif premier de la COTAL en France est d’assurer la promotion des destinations latino-américaines en devenant le point de rencontre incontournable des responsables et acteurs de la profession, autrement dit « L’Amérique Latine des Professionnels du Tourisme ».","1258668","","","","","","","","","",""

Each user saves as they wish and according to their budget by securing the funds via a ring-fencing account and #blockchain technology. Thanks to their subscription, they benefit from the lowest guaranteed discounts. This guarantee is made possible by the automatic application in face value of the commissions granted by the tour operators directly on the offers, or, (when this is not technically possible) by the sharing and redistribution to all subscribers of each commission received. This project in SaaS mode is intended to be as close as possible to the #web3 spirit while in accordance with the legislation in force. Each subscriber is an integral part of the project and will participate, through a voting system, in the expansion of Travel Prime and in the strategic decisions of the Start-up. The interoperable system is also positioned as a new payment system via user savings. It allows the dynamic display in superimposition of the remainder payable on partner offers. Travel Prime was announced for the first time at the big #MysterFly party at the #pavillonDauphine during the #iftm2022 event and the first press interview was signed #eventiz During this start, the first 5000 new ambassadors, by simply registering on a waiting list will have the privilege of accessing a pre-sale subscription to obtain several advantages, as the first promoters of the project, in particular: free lifetime subscription and a special status. The pre-sale will take place according to the codes of #web3, namely through the sale of an NFT collection. The date is not yet announced.

In order not to succumb to the devastating spread of mass tourism, we have decided to offer you an up-to-date selection of the best lodges, ecolodges, bungalows, cabins, gites, carbets, fares, charming hotels and straw huts in the world, accommodation that respects nature and its inhabitants, away from the crowds. Thus, you will gradually have access to accommodation that respects the environment and its inhabitants, where simplicity is luxury. Admittedly, our selection of accommodation is sometimes positioned in the middle-upper end of the market and can be more expensive, but it is preferable to enhance the appreciation of a trip by individualizing it rather than to distort local life through a massive infiltration of tourists; some destinations are revising their ""tourism"" policy in order to preserve their culture and environment, and also realize the negative impact of flat rental platforms when no limits are set. Not so long ago, in the value chain of a trip, air transport was the most expensive; today, this is often no longer the case with the arrival of low-cost airlines. Some low fare airlines are standardizing to long-haul destinations, and deeply traditional airlines are tending to reduce their costs by changing their business model on short- and medium-haul flights. It is already possible to travel in low cost - low fare within 5 to 6 hours from home, and therefore to invest more in the land part of the journey. Thus, the organisation of land-based travel becomes the key element of the trip, particularly with the emergence and know-how of local experts ( local tour operators and guides). With our partners, we continue to supply the world's most beautiful lodges, and ecolodges of the Planet and we thank you warmly for your many expressions of support.  Special thanks to our 200,000 unique visitors during this difficult period which affects us all. Jean Michel Bohn","1017310","","","","","","","","","",""

Thomas Billard – his founder – is originally from the region with 10 years experience in beach tourism. He left the area to pursue his studies and completed a Masters degree in management at Toulouse Business School. He then began a career in purchasing, working for large companies in Toulouse and then Belgium. But the pull from his roots proved too strong… and he decided in March 2016 to come back to the region and follow his heart by setting up B-Holidays. His grandfather, Raul Busquets, a Catalan who was passionate about the Eastern Pyrenees, never tired of regaling him with tales of the region’s riches. He also felt the region was little known and under-exploited, considering its wealth of attractions. This was why Thomas set up B-Holidays: to promote discovery of the local area and everything it has to offer, basing our offering on the concept of quality - and an exchange between visitors and locals. To paraphrase the famous Roussillon singer, Jordi Barre, «I want to sweep away the frontiers that defend the treasures of these horizons, through the love in my heart». This is the true spirit of B-Holidays. We’ll help you discover the Eastern Pyrenees region. But we want you to get involved and be an actor - rather than a spectator - in your holiday experience. Therefore, B-Holidays met wine producers, farmers, local cultural associations, artisans, shop owners, artists… to create original activities that get you involved whilst discovering another facet of the Eastern Pyrenees.","624672","","","","","","","","","",""

Initiated by Laurentian University president John S. Daniel who had studied in Oxford and Paris, and Sam Blyth of Blyth and Company of Toronto, a student travel agency, the program was coordinated by Douglas Parker, professor of English and former Dean of Humanities, from 1987 until 1992, and then by K. Walter Schwager, Professor of Sociology and former Dean of Social Sciences, from 1992 until 1996. Mostly including second year courses in Humanities (literature, music, history, classical studies) and language courses, the program was to equip future leaders in different areas of Canadian life with bilingual skills. Students at Ontario universities could transfer credits. They paid the same tuition fees as students at Laurentian University in Sudbury.
